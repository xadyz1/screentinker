# Phase −1 — Telemetry inventory

Input to [`mesh-directive.md`](mesh-directive.md) Phase 0. Every field the players and server collect,
what it is for, and whether it survives into 2.0.

**Why this comes first.** A field that nothing reads is three problems at once: a privacy liability
under a client's security review, a bandwidth cost multiplied by tree depth, and a row in a grant
vocabulary that has to be explained to someone. Anything marked **drop** is removed *before* Phase 2,
so it is never mirrored upward in the first place.

**Method.** Population percentages are measured against the live production database
(248,314 `device_telemetry` rows, 292 reporting devices, 509 devices total, sampled 2026-08-19).
Read-side counts are from the source. Nothing here is inferred from a schema alone — a column that
exists and is always NULL reads identically to one that works, until you count.

⚠️ **Low population means "new" or "dead", and the two are opposite conclusions.** `video_mode` sits at
0.7% and `temperature_c` at 0.0%; the first shipped nine days ago for BrightSign and is working, the
second has been collected for months and has never once been written. Date the column before judging it.

## Device telemetry (`device_telemetry`, sampled per heartbeat)

| Field | Populated | Written by | Read by | In UI | Alertable (A2) | Correct? | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `uptime_seconds` | 100% | all players | server, UI | yes | yes | yes | **keep** |
| `battery_level` | 36.4% | Android only | server, UI | yes | candidate | yes, where reported | **keep** (platform-limited) |
| `battery_charging` | 100% | all players | server only | **no** | no | **no — fabricated** | **fix, then keep** |
| `storage_free_mb` / `storage_total_mb` | 38.9% | Android, BrightSign | server, UI | yes | yes | yes | **keep** |
| `ram_free_mb` / `ram_total_mb` | 37.1% | Android, BrightSign | server, UI | yes | candidate | yes | **keep** |
| `cpu_usage` | 37.1% | Android, BrightSign | server, UI | yes | candidate | yes, over-precise | **keep, round** |
| `wifi_rssi` | 36.4% | Android | server, UI | yes | candidate | yes | **keep** |
| `wifi_ssid` | 97.5% | all players | server, UI | yes | no | **no — 94% is not an SSID** | **drop** |
| `local_ip` | 20.6% | players | server, UI | yes | no | yes | **keep** |
| `local_ip6` | 4.6% | BrightSign | server, UI | yes | no | yes | **keep** |
| `temperature_c` | 0.0% *(see below)* | **BrightSign only** | server, UI | yes | no | yes | **keep** ⚠️ *corrected* |
| `attached_display` | 0.002% | BrightSign only | server, UI | yes | no | yes — new 2026-08-10 | **keep** |
| `video_mode` | 0.7% | BrightSign only | server, UI | yes | no | yes — new 2026-08-10 | **keep** |

### `wifi_ssid` — drop

Every distinct value in production, by frequency:

| Value | Rows | Is it an SSID? |
|---|---|---|
| `Web Player` | 151,713 | no — a literal string the web player sends |
| `permission` | 41,060 | no — Android's location-permission refusal, stored verbatim |
| `<unknown ssid>` | 34,894 | no — Android's own placeholder |
| *(null)* | 6,111 | — |
| 5 real network names | 14,536 | **yes — and that is the problem** |

Two independent reasons, either sufficient:

1. **94% of it is not an SSID.** `server/player/index.html:2327` sends the literal `'Web Player'`, so
   the column has become a de-facto "what kind of player is this", which `devices.client_type` already
   records properly. The field is misnamed for what it actually holds.
2. **The 6% that IS real is the liability.** Those are customer network names — `Verizon_VKC37F`,
   `RealEstate5167788777`. Wi-Fi SSIDs are geolocatable against public wardriving databases, so this
   is a field that can place a client's premises on a map. It is exactly what a security review asks
   about, it is surfaced in the UI, nothing alerts on it, and no feature needs it.

Dropping it also removes a whole grant category from the Phase 0 vocabulary rather than having to
justify one.

### `battery_charging` — fabricated, fix before Phase 2

`server/player/index.html:2316-2317`:

```js
battery_level: null,        // honest: the web has no battery API
battery_charging: false,    // ⚠️ claims "not charging" when it means "unknown"
```

Hence 100% population against 36.4% for `battery_level`: every web player asserts `false`. It reads as
data and is not, no UI displays it, and mirroring it upward would spread a fabricated value across a
fleet. Fix is one word — `false` → `null` — after which population should track `battery_level`, and
that becomes the regression test.

This is the "battery reporting has been flagged as wrong or absent" suspicion in the directive, and the
answer is *both, in different places*: **absent** on web (correctly — no API), **wrong** on web
(`charging` fabricated), **correct** on Android (100% populated on every Android platform measured).

### ⚠️ `temperature_c` — a correction to this document

**This audit said "never written — drop". That was wrong, and it was acted on before being caught.**

The field is **BrightSign-only**. It arrives from `deviceInfo.getTemperature()` in
`brightsign/st-bridge.js`, added 2026-08-05 in *"BrightSign: real telemetry and hardware identity,
not a block of nulls"*. It works.

The measurement said 0 of 248,314 rows because **production has no BrightSign players** — the fleet
is Chrome, Firefox, Tizen and Android. The zero measured the fleet, not the field.

This is the exact trap warned about at the top of this document, applied correctly to `video_mode`
and `attached_display` (both BrightSign, both kept) and missed for `temperature_c`, which is from the
same family and the same week. The difference: those two were checked against `git log` and this one
was not, because 0.0% felt conclusive in a way 0.7% did not.

**The general lesson, which is the reason this section stays:** *a usage measurement is only as broad
as the fleet you measured.* Before deleting a field for being unused, check that the platform which
writes it is present in the sample. An exactly-zero reading deserves more suspicion than a small one,
not less — it is as likely to mean "wrong sample" as "dead code".

### `cpu_usage` — keep, but round

Stored at full float precision: `34.700234234333`, 87,297 distinct values across 248k rows. Nobody
displays more than a whole percent. Rounding at the source costs nothing and is bandwidth saved on
every hop — the exact cost the directive says to multiply by tree depth before shipping.

## Other collected surfaces

| Surface | Volume | Purpose | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `play_logs` | 1,294,987 | proof-of-play | **keep** — ⚠️ Phase 4 `no-downsample`; averaged proof-of-play is worthless |
| `event_loop_lag` | 259,127 | server self-health (#240) | **keep**, node-local; a mesh should carry a summary, not samples |
| `device_events` | 1,085 | display on/off, connectivity cause | **keep** |
| `device_status_log` | 438 | online/offline with reason | **keep** — the uptime report in Phase 3 is built on it |
| `device_usage_daily` | 613 | per-day rollup | **keep** |
| `device_fingerprints` | 395 | hardware identity | **keep**, node-local — never mirror; it is how a device is re-identified locally |
| `player_debug_logs` | 106 | opt-in live debug | **keep**, node-local, already opt-in |
| `telemetry_reports` | 8 | install statistics collector | **keep** — separate opt-in system, not part of the mesh |

### `devices.ip_address` — a grant category, not a drop

Populated for **509 of 509** devices, and the values are **public WAN addresses** (`109.250.…`,
`171.76.…`, `80.51.…`, `2401:49…`), not LAN ones. It is legitimately used for reachability and
support, so it stays — but it identifies where a client's premises are, and under the directive it
must be its own grant category so a client can grant health without granting location. A "health only"
grant that still ships the public IP of every screen would not survive the review the directive is
written for.

## Falling out of this

> without a guard is only a deferral, and none of these reasons are visible from the code.

> ⚠️ **`temperature_c` was DROPPED AND THEN RESTORED. This audit got it wrong.** See the correction

1. **Drop `wifi_ssid`** — stop collecting, remove from the UI, retire the column.
2. **Fix `battery_charging`** — `false` → `null` on web, with a test that population tracks
   `battery_level`.
3. **Drop `temperature_c`** — never written by anything, in any player, since it was added.
4. **Round `cpu_usage`** at the source.

All four are done. Items 1 and 3 were removals that the directive required before Phase 2; they
slipped past it and were caught by an audit rather than by the plan, which is worth noting — a
"must land before X" with nothing enforcing it is a note, not a gate.

## Grant vocabulary this implies (input to Phase 0)

Grouped so a client can grant one and deny the next:

- **health** — uptime, storage, RAM, CPU, battery, Wi-Fi signal strength
- **identity** — device name, hardware model, serial, app version
- **network** — LAN address, **public/WAN address** (separable; see above)
- **display** — attached display, video mode, orientation, screenshots
- **content-metadata** — playlist and content names, schedules
- **proof-of-play** — play logs (⚠️ no-downsample)
- **diagnostics** — device events, status log, debug logs

`wifi_ssid` would have been an eighth category. Dropping it removes the need for one.
