# Triggers

**Status: BUILT AND ENABLEABLE over the API; no dashboard UI yet, and unverified on hardware.**
Externally-fired events that put interrupt content over a running playlist, resolved entirely on the
device.

Enablement is `POST /api/devices/:id/trigger-config` (accept flags, ports, multicast group,
clear-all token) and `POST /api/devices/:id/trigger-secret` (generate or set). Both push the device
a playlist-update immediately and report whether it was `delivered`, so an operator is told whether
the panel actually has it rather than left to assume.

⚠️ **The secret has exactly one write path and is never returned to an API token.** It is the
credential that lets an unauthenticated LAN datagram change what a screen shows, so rotating it is
a deliberate act rather than a side effect of editing a port number, and a read-scoped integration
must never be able to turn "may list your screens" into "may put content on any of them".

⚠️ **The clear-all token is validated against the trigger token namespace.** `evaluate()` tests it
BEFORE iterating the device's triggers, so a value equal to some trigger's `match_token` would make
that trigger permanently unfirable on that device — and nothing would log it, because from the
resolver's point of view the token matched.

### Delivery: the content is on the device before it is needed

A trigger fires with the WAN down, which is only true if the definition *and* the target playlist's
media are already local. So:

- Creating, editing or deleting a trigger pushes a playlist-update to every device it touches, now.
  An edit captures the affected set *before* the assignment rewrite, so a device losing the trigger
  is told too; a delete reads it before the row goes, because `trigger_assignments` cascades.
- Publishing a playlist fans out to devices that hold it **only as a trigger target**. The base
  query is `WHERE playlist_id = ?`, which never contained them — so an operator could swap the
  evacuation notice, see "Published", and have every panel keep firing the old items.
- The payload carries each trigger's playlist resolved inline, and the player re-pins on a
  trigger-set change, so one message delivers both the definition and the cache instruction.

### Android

The stack is assembled in `MainActivity` — `TriggerManager` ties transports → resolver → state
machine → `TriggerOverlay`, which renders the trigger's playlist into the PiP layer from the OFFLINE
CACHE and never fetches on the fire path. It owns its own ExoPlayer: reusing the base playlist's
would tear down the thing the overlay is supposed to be covering, and a clear would have nothing to
return to. Base audio is suppressed through `MediaPlayerManager.setTriggerMute`, a flag consulted
where the volume is decided rather than a one-shot write the next item mount would undo.

⚠️ `TriggerRenderer` is an interface so the arbitration logic is testable without a Context. That is
not ceremony: the web player's fire-path suite stubs its renderer, which is exactly how it shipped
green while a trigger produced a black, silent screen on real hardware.

### ⚠️ Unverified on BrightSign hardware

`audio.mute` / `audio.volume` are DECLARED capabilities asserting that the DOM's `el.muted` and
`el.volume` reach the audio path. On this platform video decodes onto a hardware plane the DOM
cannot touch — which is why the screen-off path tears the source down rather than pausing — and
whether audio routes the same way has never been established. DWS exposes no audio-state endpoint
and no JS API reports whether sound is leaving the box, so **it cannot be settled remotely; it needs
ears at a panel.**

Mitigation shipped: the player writes BOTH `muted = true` and `volume = 0`, so it survives either
one being honoured. If NEITHER reaches the plane, base-audio suppression is a silent no-op on
exactly the hardware the feature exists for, and there is no host-side fallback — nothing in
`brightsign/st-bridge.js` touches `@brightsign/audiooutput`. `brightsign/audio-plane-test.html` is a
probe that plays a tone and toggles each mechanism in turn with a printed verdict table; it needs
someone at the panel to say when it goes silent.

Remaining: the hardware check above, and Tizen (deliberately excluded — no raw socket).
tested against a BrightSign hardware audio plane.

## Why

An AV integrator: *"the player receives a REST JSON message or a UDP message and it starts playing
another playlist… a configuration interface that sets the triggers and the corresponding playlist,
and whether playback plays once or loops until the trigger is cleared."*

⚠️ **It must work with the WAN down. That is the entire feature.** Nothing in the fire path may
depend on reaching the hub — not to resolve a token, not to fetch content, not to log. A trigger
that needs the internet is a trigger that fails on the day the internet is why you needed it.

The gear that fires these is Crestron, Extron and PLCs. That equipment emits a one-line raw socket
send. It will not do TLS, auth headers, or JSON bodies. The wire format is designed for what that
hardware can actually emit, not for what is pleasant to specify.

---

## What already exists, and what that decided

Three findings from the existing code shaped this more than any preference did.

**`pipShow(p)` / `pipClear(id)` (`server/player/index.html`) render the manual PiP overlay.** They
share the `#pipContainer` layer with triggers but are NOT the trigger render path — §4 describes what
was actually built: `triggerFire` creates its own `.trigger-box` and renders the trigger's playlist
through `showZoneItem`, because a trigger targets a PLAYLIST and `pipShow` renders a single item.

⚠️ Sharing one container has a cost that was found the hard way: both owners used to clear it with
`innerHTML = ''`, so each silently destroyed the other's DOM while the other's state machine carried
on believing it was on screen. Each now removes only its own class, and the layer has an explicit
z-order (a trigger always outranks a PiP).

**`pruneToPlaylist(urls)` (`server/player/sw.js`) deletes any content-cache entry not in the playlist
URL set.** A trigger target is therefore not merely un-prefetched, it is *actively evicted* unless it
joins that set. Pinning is not a new subsystem; it is appending to the existing `st-cache-playlist`
message.

**`showZoneItem(zone, div, items, index)` is already a scoped, multi-instance rotation engine.** It
takes its own container and item list, keys its timer, handles widget/youtube/video/image, honours
per-item schedules, and advances on duration or video-end. A multi-zone layout runs several of them
at once. The overlay is one more instance.

---

## Decisions, and what each one prevents

### 1. The target is a PLAYLIST, not a URL

This reversed during design, and the cache policy is why. `isCacheableContent()` only matches library
content, so an arbitrary `http://…` target **cannot be pinned** — it would be fetched live, which is
exactly the WAN-down guarantee failing at the only moment it matters.

Playlist items are already library content. They already flow through the prefetch chain and are
already protected from the prune. Pinning becomes: resolve `target_ref` → playlist → item URLs,
append to `st-cache-playlist`. No policy change, no warning, no asterisk.

⚠️ **"Playlist items are pinnable" was too strong, and the gap is now closed at save time.**
`requestOfflineCache` pins `filepath && !remote_url`, so a playlist item carrying a `remote_url` is
never held on the device, and a YouTube item cannot be held at all. A trigger pointing at such a
playlist satisfies every structural check in this section and *still* fires against nothing with the
WAN down — the same failure a URL target would cause, arriving through the front door. The API
therefore refuses a target playlist containing unpinnable items, naming which ones, because the
alternative is discovering it during an alarm.

The invariant is enforced at four layers, and it is worth knowing all four: the API restricts
`target_kind` to `playlist` and validates `target_ref` against the workspace; `columnsFrom` never
writes `target_url`, so it is always NULL; the wire resolves `items` from `published_snapshot` only
when `target_kind === 'playlist'`; and `triggerFire` renders `trigger.items` — there is no code path
in any player that renders a URL.

```sql
target_kind TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'playlist',   -- v1: 'playlist'; later: 'url'
target_ref  TEXT,                               -- v1: the playlist id
target_url  TEXT                                -- v1: NULL
```

`'url'` becomes the later addition, gated on the cache-policy question, and it inherits the warning.
The shape is unchanged either way, so adding it needs no migration and no backfill.

⚠️ **Consequence:** trigger playlists join the device's cache working set and compete for the same
quota as the base playlist — on a BrightSign widget that is a real budget. The UI shows combined
pinned size per device, because the alternative is a mysterious eviction.

### 2. The wire carries a TOKEN, never content

One line, ASCII, ≤512 bytes:

```
ST1 <secret> <token>
```

`ST1` is magic+version. Subnet broadcast means the socket sees every stray datagram on the LAN, so
rejecting on a 4-byte compare before parsing keeps that cheap and keeps the reject counters
meaningful. It also gives a version hook without renegotiation.

The HTTP path accepts **four shapes**, because the control-system world cannot agree on one:

```
POST /            ST1 <secret> <token>            # raw line, text/plain
POST /            {"secret":"…","token":"…"}      # JSON envelope
POST /            secret=…&token=…                # form-encoded
GET  /trigger?secret=…&token=…                    # query parameters
GET  /trigger?m=ST1%20<secret>%20<token>          # a whole raw line, url-encoded
```

⚠️ **GET is not a convenience — it is the only HTTP two of the five major control platforms can
emit.** AMX NetLinx has no HTTP client and no TLS anywhere in the language: every request is
hand-concatenated strings with a manually computed `Content-Length`, and its own community's advice
is to "start with a full-blown header, then take stuff out one at a time until it breaks". Extron's
Global Scripter *forbids* the `http`, `socket` and `ssl` modules outright (so `urllib` is gone too)
while still allowing `json`/`hmac`/`hashlib` — an Extron integrator can compute an HMAC but cannot
open a socket. A POST-JSON-only door is unreachable from both. The secret rides in the query string
for the same reason Carousel's CAP endpoint takes its token there: plenty of this gear cannot set a
request header at all.

**Framing is deliberately liberal**, and this is the documentation of that. Trailing `\r`, `\n`,
`\r\n`, a NUL byte, or nothing at all are all accepted, and leading/trailing whitespace is trimmed.
Crestron's own worked example emits HTTP/1.0 with bare LF; Q-SYS ships an EOL constant literally
called `Any` *and* one called `Null`; AMX appends `$0D,$0A` by hand and sometimes forgets. BrightSign
does **not** trim and its docs warn that "leading/trailing spaces do matter" — a recurring support
burden we are choosing not to reproduce. Payloads are capped at **1024 bytes**, which is Extron's
limit rather than ours: ControlScript truncates UDP there and delivers at most 1024 per receive
event, so a longer message is not one we could have received intact.

**The reply is newline-terminated.** Extron integrators confirm delivery with
`SendAndWait(data, timeout, deliTag=…)` — they read until a known suffix — so an unterminated body
blocks them until timeout on a request that actually succeeded.

⚠️ **This is the core security property, not a convenience.** The wire never carries a URL, a
duration or a position. An attacker who guesses a token can only display content an operator already
configured for that screen.

Clear uses the same format: a per-trigger `clear_token`, plus a device-level clear-all. One format,
one parser, one handler; token resolution decides fire vs clear.

### 3. One socket, three addressing modes

`dgram`, `udp4`, `reuseAddr`, bound `0.0.0.0:PORT`. That single bind receives unicast and subnet
broadcast inherently. Multicast is the *same socket* plus `addMembership(group, ifaceAddr)` — not a
second code path. Default group `239.255.42.1`, port `7847`, outbound TTL 1.

**Rejoin is what decides whether this works in the field.** Interface polling alone misses the common
failure: a switch doing IGMP snooping stops forwarding the group when it misses a membership report,
and nothing on the host looks wrong. So:

- unconditional re-`addMembership` every 90s (errors swallowed; re-adding is harmless) — this is the
  backstop that fixes the silent case by emitting a fresh IGMP report;
- an `os.networkInterfaces()` watch that drops and rejoins on address change — the fast path for
  DHCP renewal, link flap and wake.

Both transports converge on `handleTrigger({token, secret, source, sourceIp})`.

### 4. Reuse `showZoneItem`, with one refactor

The overlay is an instance of the existing rotation engine rendering into a div inside
`#pipContainer` with a synthetic `{id:'__trigger__'}`. Per-item scheduling inside a trigger playlist
comes free.

⚠️ It needs one change: `showZoneItem` writes `zoneTimers[zone.id]`, and `renderZones()` calls
`clearZoneTimers()` which wipes the whole map — so **a layout change landing mid-interrupt would
silently kill the overlay's advance timer and freeze it on one item.** Fix is a default parameter,
`showZoneItem(zone, div, items, index, timers = zoneTimers)`, with the trigger passing its own store.
One argument, backward-compatible, and it removes a cross-talk bug rather than routing around it.

### 5. `once` plays the playlist through; `max_duration_sec` is a cap

`once` = play the trigger playlist through once, then hide.

The field is **`max_duration_sec`**, deliberately not `duration_sec`. The PiP contract already uses
`duration` where `0` means *until cleared*; here `0` means *no cap*. Two adjacent fields where the
same value means opposite things is a trap, so the name differs because the semantics differ. It also
sits correctly beside `lease_sec`.

If the playlist is longer than the cap, **the cap wins and the overlay hides mid-playlist.** The cap
exists so a misconfigured trigger cannot hold a screen indefinitely; honouring the playlist instead
would make the safety valve advisory. Logged as `[trigger] once capped at Ns (playlist needs Ms)`.

The sum of item durations is known at save time, so the UI validates it and warns in the editor. An
installer finds out while configuring, not at 3am.

### 6. `until_cleared` gets an optional LEASE

⚠️ **A clear is a single unacked datagram.** If it drops, or the sender dies mid-alarm, the screen is
stuck with no path back except someone driving to the site.

Senders already re-assert on a timer (§8) — so that re-assertion becomes load-bearing. Optional
`lease_sec` on `until_cleared` triggers:

- each matching re-fire **renews** the lease;
- expiry with no renewal auto-clears, logged `[trigger] lease expired, auto-cleared`;
- explicit clear still works and stays the fast path — the lease is a backstop, not the mechanism;
- **unset means hold indefinitely**, which is today's behaviour, so this is opt-in.

The same re-fire that §8 makes a playback no-op is the liveness signal here. One mechanism, two jobs:
the chatty sender stops being a nuisance and becomes the thing that proves the alarm is still real.

⚠️ **A held-but-preempted trigger's lease still ticks.** The assertion is about the world, not about
the screen. A lease that expired while preempted must be dropped from the held set, or it pops back
when the higher-priority overlay clears — reasserting a condition that has already lapsed.

**What the UI does about UDP-without-lease.** That is the stuck-screen configuration, so it is called
out where it is created and where it is diagnosed:

- the trigger editor **prefills `lease_sec = 90` for new triggers with UDP enabled**, clearable. The
  stored semantic is unchanged — unset still means indefinite — but the safe value is the one you
  have to remove rather than the one you have to find;
- clearing it shows an inline warning naming the actual failure: *"if the clear datagram is lost this
  screen holds the overlay until someone clears it by hand"*;
- it is **not blocked.** An operator with a reliable HTTP clear path, or who genuinely wants an
  indefinite hold, has a legitimate configuration;
- device diagnostics show it as a standing condition, not only at save time — a trigger written
  before this existed, or assigned to a new screen later, still surfaces where an installer looks;
- an active `until_cleared` overlay with no lease is flagged in the live view as *held indefinitely*.

### 7. Collisions: highest-priority-wins, with `until_cleared` held

Not an interrupt stack. A stack accumulates expired one-shots and needs eviction rules nobody gets
right; pure last-wins loses a still-valid condition.

Only `until_cleared` triggers are **held** when preempted — a `once` that was interrupted has had its
moment, and restoring it later shows stale content at the wrong time. On any clear, the
highest-priority still-held trigger re-renders.

Concretely: "room occupied" (p10) preempted by "evacuate" (p100); when evacuate clears, "room
occupied" returns, because nothing ever said it stopped being true. A p10 `once` promo does not.

Ties go to the last arrival, matching the existing last-show-wins semantics so the manual and
triggered paths behave identically. A lower priority arriving while a higher is active is dropped,
counted, and logged with both names.

### 8. A resumed trigger restarts at item 1 — but a re-fire does not restart

A held trigger is a *state assertion*, not a paused timeline. If "evacuate" was authored with the
exit map as item 1, resuming at item 4 makes the first three items unreachable for as long as the
preemption lasted. Resuming position also means per-trigger playback state surviving preemption —
state that leaks, and that nobody notices is wrong.

⚠️ **Re-firing a trigger that is already active is a no-op, not a restart.** Crestron and PLC gear
re-assert on a timer, and subnet broadcast produces duplicates anyway. If every repeat restarted the
overlay, a sender re-asserting every 5s would freeze a 6-item emergency loop on item 1 forever — and
it would look like the playlist was broken, not like the sender was chatty. A repeat renews the lease
(§6) and changes nothing else.

### 9. Decoder contention: TESTED ON HARDWARE — composite, do not preempt

⚠️ **RESOLVED 2026-08-22 on the XT245 (BOS 10.0.16). Two simultaneous video decodes work.** The
preempt policy this section used to propose is not needed and is not being built.

The test: a two-zone layout (`tpl-split-h`, 50/50) with a different mp4 in each zone, assigned to
the player on that box, captured through the DWS native screenshot — which composites the hardware
plane, so it sees what the panel shows rather than what the DOM knows.

A single frame cannot tell two live decoders from two first-frames painted and frozen, so two
captures 96 seconds apart were compared half by half. Both sides advanced, independently:

| | 10:12:01 | 10:13:37 |
|---|---|---|
| left | *"Twenty phones were the last of the run…"* | *"To flash us the sixty, every one!"* |
| right | *"Welcome to the search results…"* | *"Boot failure, Secure Boot violation detected"* |

Mean per-pixel delta between frames: left 18.3, right 4.6 — neither zero, and the burned-in lyrics
put the two clips at unmistakably different playback positions.

**Three things this settles:**

1. **The overlay composites over base video.** No preemption, no base teardown, no `playCurrentItem()`
   resume path, and §7's held-set logic gets simpler for it.
2. **Multi-video zone layouts are NOT broken on BrightSign.** That was the live alternative
   hypothesis and it is dead; there is no zones bug to file.
3. **A hardware video plane composites through an IFRAME.** On a server-mode box the player runs
   inside one (`node-server.html` since #290), which was a second unknown stacked on the first. Both
   videos rendered correctly through that boundary.

`videoCompositingAvailable()` stays where it is and keeps doing its existing job for transitions. It
is simply not wired to a preemption decision, because there is nothing to decide.

⚠️ **Scope of the claim, so nobody over-reads it:** one model (XT245, Series 5 "cobra"), one
firmware, two 1080p-class clips, node-enabled widget. It does not establish a decoder budget. A
four-zone all-video layout, or 4K sources, are separate questions this test does not answer — and if
one of those fails, the answer is a documented zone budget, not a trigger-specific preempt path.

### 10. Two flags, both default OFF

`TRIGGERS_ACCEPT_HTTP` and `TRIGGERS_ACCEPT_UDP`, following the `MESH_ACCEPT_ENROLLMENT` /
`MESH_ALLOW_UPLINK` convention — and the argument is stronger here than for the mesh.

HTTP is unicast TCP to one host; the blast radius is whoever can route to it. UDP multicast or
broadcast means **one datagram changes every screen in the building at once.** Those are different
risks. The Wi-Fi guidance (§12) makes HTTP-only a real deployment rather than a theoretical one, and
a single flag would force an operator who wants the safe transport to open the dangerous one.

For the player page, which env vars cannot reach, the flags are per-device settings pushed from the
hub and cached locally so they survive WAN loss. The on-device server honours the env equivalents.
Assigning a trigger to a screen whose listener is off warns rather than silently doing nothing.

⚠️ **SETTLED: the listener lives in the PLAYER, not in an on-device server.** It was tempting to put
the HTTP transport on the local server's existing Express listener — no new port, no binding, no
capability probe, and the player is already connected to it over localhost. That is genuinely
simpler, and it is wrong, because **a site may have no on-prem server at all.** Players there talk
to a hosted hub, so with the WAN down there is no local server to receive anything. A design that
works only where a server happens to be on site fails exactly the deployment the feature exists for.

The consequence is worth stating plainly rather than discovering later: a **plain browser player
cannot listen on a port at all**, so it gets neither transport. Triggers require a Node-capable
player runtime — which on BrightSign means a node-enabled widget, probed by trying. §12's degradation
is therefore the normal case for browser players, not an edge case.

### 11. Threat model: unauthenticated content injection on a LAN you do not control

- Flags off by default: a site that never sets them has no listener and no open port.
- Per-device shared secret required in every payload, rotatable per device.
- Token resolution is scoped to triggers **assigned to this screen** — a valid token for another
  screen does nothing here.
- Optional source-IP allowlist.
- Per-source token bucket. ⚠️ Reject *logging* is rate-limited to one line per window per reason,
  mirroring the `[content-ack] shedding` fix: a packet flood must not become a log flood.
- Bounded effect: the overlay layer only. No schedule mutation, no publish, no hub call, and no
  arbitrary URL from the wire.

**Residual, stated plainly:** UDP on a shared LAN is spoofable and the secret is cleartext on the
wire. The mitigation is deployment guidance — a dedicated AV VLAN — plus the fact that a successful
forgery shows the operator's own approved content. Better written down than implied to be
authentication.

### 12. Platforms

Capability is **probed, never inferred**: `require('dgram')`, bind, join, and only then declare.
That is the existing rule in `declaredCapabilities()` (*"a capability we cannot verify is left out"*)
and the same lesson as `read-runner.js` detecting worker_threads by trying. `trigger.http` and
`trigger.udp` become declared capabilities, so the UI shows per screen which transports work.

Browser players get neither and say so. On wireless devices multicast is unreliable by design: the UI
warns and recommends unicast HTTP, but does not disable UDP.

### 13. Observability: one number answers the site visit

`[trigger]` on every fire, accept and reject, into the existing `__debugLog_push` / `device:log` sink.

| field | why |
|---|---|
| `udp.group`, `udp.port`, `udp.iface_addr`, `joined_at`, `rejoin_count`, `last_join_error` | is membership actually held |
| **`last_datagram_at`** | **any** datagram, including rejected ones |
| `received` / `accepted` / `rejected{bad_magic,bad_secret,unknown_token,not_assigned,rate_limited}` | which half of the path failed |
| `active_overlay{trigger, mode, since, source, source_ip, lease_expires_at}` | what is on screen and why |

⚠️ **`last_datagram_at` counting rejected traffic is the whole point.** Recent timestamp with zero
accepts means multicast *is* reaching the player and the token or secret is wrong. Null timestamp
means nothing is arriving and it is the network. Those are different site visits, and telling them
apart is the single most valuable diagnostic in this feature.

Plus a **loopback self-test**: the player sends one datagram to its own group and reports whether it
received it — proving socket and membership without involving the integrator's gear at all.

## Data model

```sql
triggers (
  id, workspace_id, name,
  match_token, clear_token,
  source_http INTEGER DEFAULT 1, source_udp INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  target_kind TEXT DEFAULT 'playlist', target_ref TEXT, target_url TEXT,
  position, width, height, opacity, border_radius,   -- ⚠️ RESERVED: copied from the PiP contract,
                                  -- wired to nothing. A trigger always renders fullscreen and
                                  -- opaque. Not projected to devices, not in the shared contract,
                                  -- and the API 400s if you send one. Columns kept because SQLite
                                  -- drops need a table rebuild and this schema treats unused
                                  -- columns as the no-migration hook. If a partial mode is ever
                                  -- wanted, add ONE semantic field (takeover | banner) instead.
  mode TEXT,                      -- once | until_cleared
  max_duration_sec INTEGER,       -- once: upper bound; 0/unset = no cap
  lease_sec INTEGER,              -- until_cleared: renew-or-expire; unset = indefinite
  priority INTEGER DEFAULT 0, enabled INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  created_at, updated_at )

trigger_assignments (trigger_id, target_type TEXT /* device|group */, target_id)
```

Tenancy is `workspace_id`, this codebase's unit — `pip.js` scopes every query by `req.workspaceId`,
so isolation comes free from the existing helpers rather than from new checks.

Definitions ride the existing `device:playlist-update` payload as top-level `data.triggers`, beside
`layout` / `group_sync` / `timezone`, with their own signature comparison mirroring `layoutSig`.
⚠️ They must **not** enter the item fingerprint, or every trigger edit restarts playback (#234).
Persisted via `saveTriggersCache()` → localStorage, mirroring `saveLayoutCache`, and loaded at boot
before the socket connects: triggers work on a cold boot with the WAN down, or they do not work.

---

## Risks

**The listener changes what is on a screen, from the LAN, unauthenticated by the standards of the
transport.** §10 and §11 are the answer, and the flags defaulting off are the part that matters most.

**Multicast membership loss is silent.** §3's periodic rejoin is a treatment, not a cure — a switch
that never forwards the group at all looks identical from the host. §13's `last_datagram_at` is what
makes that diagnosable rather than a guess.

**A stuck `until_cleared` overlay is the worst failure this feature can produce**, because it is a
screen showing the wrong thing with the base playlist invisible behind it. §6's lease is the backstop
and §6's UI rules are how an operator avoids configuring the failure in the first place.

**Trigger playlists compete for the cache quota** (§1). Silent eviction would present as a trigger
that fires and shows nothing.

---

## Order of work

1. Schema, entity CRUD, assignment to screens and groups.
2. `showZoneItem` timers default parameter — on its own, with the cross-talk bug covered by a test.
3. Sync to device, local persistence, pinning into `st-cache-playlist`.
4. The single internal handler + HTTP transport, behind its flag.
5. UDP transport on one socket, membership and rejoin, behind its flag.
6. Priority, held set, lease, and the collision rules.
7. Observability counters, the capability probe, and the loopback self-test.
8. ~~The XT245 concurrent-decode test, then §9's preempt policy.~~ **Done 2026-08-22** — decodes
   compose, no preempt path to build. See §9.
