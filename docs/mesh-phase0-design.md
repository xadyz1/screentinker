# Phase 0 — design: schema and interfaces

Schema and interfaces only. **No behavior**: with `MESH_ACCEPT_ENROLLMENT` and `MESH_ALLOW_UPLINK`
both off — the defaults — nothing in this phase reads a table, opens a socket, or draws a pixel.

This is the review gate. Everything downstream inherits these decisions, so the ones that were *close*
are called out at the bottom rather than buried.

## Decisions

### Edges are a table. `parent_id` is forbidden.

A node has N edges. The alternative — a parent pointer on the node — forecloses multi-parent, and two
real cases need it:

- **MSP overlap.** Your hub observes a client's server *while* the client's own hub also observes it.
  Both are legitimate, simultaneous, and carry different grants.
- **Hub migration.** Moving a fleet between hubs needs both edges alive briefly, or the migration is a
  cutover with a gap.

Adding the second parent later would be a schema change under live data. Allowing it now costs one
table. `UNIQUE (peer_node_id, direction)` also gives duplicate-identity refusal at the storage layer,
so a cloned VM cannot open a second edge underneath the application check.

### Grants are data categories, not read/write

Nine read categories, each separately grantable and deniable. Two properties matter more than the
list:

- **Default denied, no wildcard.** A grant is an explicit list, so a category added in a future
  version cannot retroactively widen an edge agreed before it existed. There is no `*`.
- **Enforced at the source (I10).** A denied category is never sent — not sent-and-filtered.

Two splits came directly out of the Phase −1 audit and would not have been obvious from the schema:

- **`network-wan` is separate from `network-lan`.** `devices.ip_address` is populated for **509 of 509**
  production devices and holds *public* addresses, which locate a client's premises. A health-only
  grant that still shipped them would fail the review this vocabulary exists for.
- **`display-capture` is separate from `display`.** Knowing the video mode is not consent to see what
  is on the screen.

There is no `wifi-ssid` category, because that field is being dropped.

**Consequence that must reach the UI:** a health-only grant makes those devices **un-searchable by
name**. The empty state has to say so, or it reads as a bug and someone "fixes" it by widening the
grant.

### Write categories exist and are refused

`content-push` and `device-command` are in the vocabulary and rejected by validation. This is the one
deliberate exception to "no stubs, no dormant paths" (I2), and it is narrow: nothing can grant them,
so no code path consults them. What it buys is that an edge stored in 2.0 is still a valid edge when
Phase 5 lands, and an operator reading the model today is not surprised later by a permission that
appeared from nowhere.

### Capabilities are a set, not an enum

The test of this design: adding a node type must require **no schema change and no new branch in
pairing**. "Regional cache that also consumes proof-of-play but does not relay" is a different set,
not a new type.

Capability is **not** permission. `relays-for-subtree` says a node carries traffic; the grant says what
it may read. Conflating them is how "it relays for us" becomes "it can read everything it relays" —
which I5 exists to forbid.

### Envelope stable, body versioned, two clocks

The envelope is what a relay reads; the body is what an endpoint reads. Splitting them is what lets a
mid-tier node forward a payload type invented after it was installed. Collapse them and a hub upgrade
breaks every older child at once.

**Two clocks, never one.** `origin_ts` from the observing node, `receipts[]` appended per hop. Nodes
are other people's machines: a site server two hours ahead would silently interleave its alerts into
the middle of yesterday in a hub's inbox, with nothing on screen explaining why the story does not add
up. Carrying both lets skew be *detected and shown* (`skewIsNotable`, ≥10 min) instead of quietly
corrupting history. Receipts **append** — overwriting the first destroys the only evidence of where a
delay was introduced.

An **unknown payload type is not an error**; it returns `relayOnly`. So does a *known* type at a newer
body version, which is the subtler case: parsing it as if it were ours would silently misread it.

### Version floor: **2.0.0**

Not a conservative guess — no earlier build can speak mesh, because the protocol does not exist before
it. The reason to name it now is that *without* a stated floor the envelope can never change: every
future edit has to stay compatible with everything ever shipped, so it does not get edited.

⚠️ **This is a different promise from player compatibility**, which stays maximal and is unchanged. A
player is a screen on a wall nobody may touch for three years. A node is a participant that writes into
someone else's database and takes five minutes to stand up.

An unparseable version is **refused**, not waved through: a peer that cannot state its version cannot
be held to a contract, and "unknown" is what a broken or hostile peer reports.

### Clients — the grouping primitive above node

`mesh_clients` + `mesh_client_access`. **Not a workspace**: the six existing roles are workspace-scoped,
and a workspace lives *inside* one server, while a client may own three. "Every tech at the MSP sees
every client" is what you get without this table, and it does not survive a security review.

**Default deny by absence.** No row in `mesh_client_access` means no visibility, so a newly added
client is invisible until someone is named. The alternative — visible-unless-denied — silently exposes
every new client to every tech the moment it is added, which is the wrong direction for a mistake to
fail in.

### Per-client roles — `viewer` and `manager`

Taken while it was still a `CREATE TABLE` edit rather than a migration against live rows.

⚠️ **The obvious model is wrong for 2.0.** "Read-only on Acme, full on Contoso" sounds like a
read/write split, but a hub cannot write to a client's screens at all — I2 makes the mesh
upward-only and there is no downward command handler to authorise. A "full access" role would grant
a capability that does not exist, which is worse than no role: it reads as a promise the product does
not keep, and an operator would reasonably assume their tech can act on a screen when they cannot.

The axis that genuinely differs per client is control of the **relationship**:

| Role | May |
|---|---|
| `viewer` | see this client's mirrored data, bounded by what the client granted |
| `manager` | additionally change retention, rotate tokens, disenroll, and move nodes between clients |

A tech who can view Acme's screens is a very different risk from one who can sever Acme's edge — and
the second is what a client asks about when they ask who at the MSP can do what.

**A third role arrives with Phase 5 and is deliberately not modelled.** That is an asymmetry with
`grants.js`, which models its write categories and refuses them — and the difference is where the
value is negotiated. A grant is agreed between two nodes across a version boundary, so its vocabulary
must be stable or an edge stored today becomes unreadable later. A role is local to this hub's
database and is never sent anywhere, so adding an enum value later is purely additive. Pre-modelling
a role whose semantics cannot yet be pinned down would mean guessing, and the guess would be
load-bearing by the time anyone checked.

Everything unrecognised **fails closed**: an unknown role grants nothing rather than falling back to
`viewer`, because "lowest role" still means seeing a client's data. `platform_admin` resolves to
`manager` everywhere, which is honest rather than contained — the instance owner can grant themselves
any row anyway, and the property a client actually cares about is that an ordinary technician sees
only the clients they were named on.

### Clients nest, and access inherits — but never silently

⚠️ **Inheritance collides with default-deny-by-absence, and the collision is the design.** The rule
above says a new client is invisible until somebody is named on it. Inheritance breaks that by
construction: put a client under West Region and everyone holding West Region can see it, with nobody
naming them.

Both properties are worth keeping, so the resolution is not to pick one. Inherited access is allowed;
it just may never be **silent**:

- `resolveAccess` always returns **provenance** — `direct`, `inherited` (and via which ancestor), or
  `platform-admin`. There is deliberately no way to ask "what is my role" and get a bare answer, because
  a UI that cannot tell the two apart cannot warn about the second.
- `whoGainsAccess(child, parent)` answers *"who is about to be able to see this"* **before** the move
  is saved, so the UI can say "3 users will gain access to Acme through West Region" and the operator
  agrees to it rather than discovering it.

The dangerous property was never inheritance. It was inheritance nobody was told about.

**Most-specific wins**, so a child row can *narrow* an inherited role — manager across West Region but
viewer on the one client under NDA. An inherit-the-maximum model cannot express that, and it is the
case an MSP will actually hit.

**An unrecognised role stops the walk** rather than being skipped. Skipping would continue up the chain
and hand the user the *broader* inherited role, quietly turning a typo into an escalation.

**Depth is capped at 4** — holding company → MSP → region → client. Resolution walks this chain on
every permission check, so unbounded depth is unbounded work on a hot path plus a pathological case if
someone builds a 500-deep chain by script. Cycles are refused by reachability (the same reasoning as
I3), and `ancestorChain` additionally stops on a repeat so a cycle in *stored* data — a hand-edited
row — fails a request instead of hanging one.

### Tombstones

Deleting a device on a child must not vanish it from the parent: last month's uptime report cannot
change retroactively, or no report is citable. `deleted_at` plus a purge horizon that is **per edge**,
so a client whose own retention is shorter binds the parent to it.

### Migration is a no-op

Five empty tables. Note they are `CREATE TABLE`, which the migration loop deliberately does not count
as applied work — only `ADD COLUMN` does — so a healthy boot stays silent rather than announcing
migrations it did not perform. Guarded by the schema test.

---

## Judgement calls worth a second opinion

These were decided to keep Phase 0 moving. Each is cheap to change now and expensive after Phase 1.

1. **`direction` on the edge is `up`/`down` and stored on both sides.** Slight redundancy — each node
   stores its own view of the same edge — but it means neither side has to derive its relationship
   from the other's table, which matters when they disagree after a partition.
2. **Skew threshold of 10 minutes** for "notable". A minute is transit noise; ten is a story that will
   not add up. Arbitrary within an order of magnitude.

## Not built here, on purpose

No pairing flow, no transport, no sync, no UI, no background sweep. Phase 0 is the shape; Phase 1 is
the first thing that moves. The topology test harness is a **Phase 1 deliverable** and is where I6 and
I8 finally become testable — they are stated in `ARCHITECTURE.md` today with no guard, and that gap is
recorded rather than papered over.
