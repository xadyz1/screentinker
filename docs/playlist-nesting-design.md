# Playlists of playlists

**Status: PHASE 1 BUILT (stateless). Phase 2 (cursored) not started.** A playlist that can contain
another playlist as an item.

Researched against 17 vendors in three tiers (open/SMB, enterprise, hardware-vendor CMS). Where a
claim below is sourced it is because it changes a decision; where the industry could not be
established, that is said rather than smoothed over.

## ⚠️ The finding that decides the architecture

Two research tiers appeared to contradict each other outright:

- Open/SMB and hardware tiers: *"nesting is resolved before the player sees it."* Xibo flattens in
  `expandWidgets()` before the XLF is built; BrightSign inlines super states into `autoplay-*.json`.
- Enterprise tier: *"unanimous — the player resolves nesting at runtime. Not one vendor flattens."*

**Both are correct. The split is not by vendor, it is by whether the nested playlist has a CURSOR.**

A cursored sub-playlist plays *some* of its items per parent rotation and remembers where it got to.
Scala: *"play this many items each time"* — five ads at N=1 means *"all five will have played once
the entire master playlist has repeated five times."* Signagelive's "Play one" mode: *"sequentially
playing the next asset with each rotation."*

**A flat list cannot express "on the third loop of the parent, play items 5–6 of the child."** The
state lives across parent rotations, so resolution must live in the player. Corroboration is strong
rather than inferred: `Pick N media items from a sub-playlist` appears as a **certified player
capability** in Scala's per-model matrix, and Korbyt's embedded-playlist support is a **versioned
firmware** feature (Samsung SoC agent 3.7.1).

BrightSign's super states *are* inlined — because they are **copies**, and a copy has no cursor.

### So the decision is not "flatten or not". It is:

| If we ship | Then |
|---|---|
| **Stateless nesting** ("always play the whole child") | Flatten at publish. Player unchanged. Snapshot, pinning, trigger offline-guard all keep working as they are. |
| **Cursored nesting** ("play 2 of the corporate block each rotation") | Player-side resolution, player-side state, and a new class of bug on every platform we ship. |

✅ **DECIDED 2026-08-23: stateless first, cursored as a separate later feature.**

The cursor is what ad-insertion needs; reusing a shared corporate block does not. Shipping the flat
version does not foreclose the cursor — but shipping the cursor first commits the player on every
platform we ship, permanently, for a capability nobody has asked for yet.

⚠️ **The one thing phase 1 must not do is make phase 2 impossible.** Concretely: the wire shape must
be able to grow a cursored variant later without a migration that rewrites published snapshots. So
the child reference keeps its identity in the item row even though the snapshot is flattened — see
`child_playlist_id` below. If phase 1 only stored the expansion, phase 2 would have nothing to
attach a cursor to.

## Phase 1 — stateless nesting, concretely

### Data model

One column, mirroring the existing `content_id` / `widget_id` discriminator pattern on
`playlist_items`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE playlist_items ADD COLUMN child_playlist_id TEXT REFERENCES playlists(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT
```

⚠️ **`ON DELETE RESTRICT`, not `SET NULL` or `CASCADE`.** A silent NULL leaves an item row that
references nothing and expands to nothing — the empty-nested-playlist black screen below. A cascade
would delete the *parent's* item. Refusing the delete is the only option that cannot surprise
anyone, and it is what makes the reverse-dependency view a requirement rather than a nicety.

### Expansion happens in `buildSnapshotItems()`, and nowhere else

That function is already the single source of the published snapshot. A child reference expands
in place, inheriting nothing except its position. The snapshot stays a **flat ordered array**, so:

- the player needs **no change at all** — it has no concept of nesting and does not gain one
- offline pinning works unchanged (flattened items are ordinary items with `filepath`)
- the trigger offline-playability guard works unchanged — it walks `published_snapshot`, which is
  post-expansion, so a nested unpinnable item is caught by the rule already shipped

### Depth 1, enforced structurally rather than by a cycle checker

Matching the industry (Signagelive states it twice: *"Double nesting is not supported"*), and
enforced the way MagicINFO does it — **by type, not by traversal**: refuse to add a child that
itself contains a child reference. A→B→A then cannot be constructed, so there is no cycle to detect.

⚠️ But unlike every vendor surveyed, **we say so out loud**: a real error naming the offending
playlist. Nobody documents a depth cap or a cycle error; it is cheap and it is a genuine
differentiator.

### Publish must fan out to ancestors — this is the known bug, one level deeper

`publishPlaylist()` currently pushes to devices whose *base* playlist matches, plus (since
2026-08-23) devices holding it as a trigger target. Nesting adds a third case: **devices whose base
playlist CONTAINS this one.**

⚠️ This is exactly the failure already fixed twice in this codebase — `pushToDevices` selected
`WHERE playlist_id = ?` and missed trigger-target devices; the trigger routes pushed nothing at all.
A fan-out that forgets a case is the recurring bug here, so phase 1 adds the ancestor query to the
same helper rather than a new call site, and a test asserts a child publish reaches a device that
only holds the parent.

### ⚠️ The restart hazard, and the mitigation

A child edit changes every ancestor's flattened items, so the structural fingerprint changes and
every screen showing any ancestor restarts at item 1. That is the #234 shape and it is the single
thing that would make this feature feel broken.

Phase 1 mitigation, in order of cost:

1. **Change-detection before republish.** If expansion produces a byte-identical snapshot, do not
   write a new one and do not push. Steals BrightSign's `CONTENT_DATA_FEED_UNCHANGED` path — the
   reset must be change-triggered, not publish-triggered. Cheap, and it covers the common case of
   an edit that does not alter the resolved list.
2. **Accept a boundary restart for genuine changes.** Neither vendor that documented this shipped a
   true mid-loop splice; Navori's non-disruptive option is *apply-at-next-loop*. Matching that is
   the pragmatic target.
3. **Deferred to its own change: a player-side diff.** Carousel proved the resume-vs-restart
   decision cannot live in the manifest — fixing CSL-9211 required a player release. Doing this
   properly means the player diffs incoming against currently-playing and preserves position. Out
   of scope for phase 1, and noted so it is not discovered later.

### Refuse to publish an empty expansion

*"Three or more 'empty' nested playlists in succession… may fail to skip… Affected: Samsung Tizen,
**BrightSign XD (8.5.47)**."* We ship BrightSign. A nested reference that expands to zero items is
refused at publish, naming the child — rather than shipping the vendor workaround of *"even if it's
just a 1-second image"*.

### Properties do NOT inherit disjunctively

⚠️ Scala's `Full Screen` and `Audio Ducking` OR across every level — *"employed if the feature is
set to On in any applicable location"* — so a child cannot defend itself against a parent, and a
fullscreen sub-playlist destroys a multi-zone layout for its turn. Ours must not do this. Item
properties belong to the item at its placement; the parent reference carries none.

### ⚠️ Found while building: a child publish must republish its ancestors

Flattening at publish means a parent's snapshot holds a **copy** of the child's items as they were
at the parent's last publish. So editing and publishing a child alone updates nothing any screen
reads — and pushing to the parent's devices (which the fan-out above already did) delivers the
parent's **stale** snapshot, so the fan-out looks correct while the content is still wrong.

This was caught by a test, not by review. It is the flatten-at-publish tax: the price of keeping the
player ignorant of nesting. Worth paying, but only if it is paid once, in the shared publish path.
`publishPlaylist()` now republishes published ancestors; drafts stay drafts.

### ⚠️ Also found while building: ON DELETE RESTRICT needs a reverse-dependency view

Adding the constraint made deleting a nested child throw a raw `SqliteError`, which reached the
client as a **500 carrying "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed" and a stack trace with server paths in
it** — a regression introduced by the constraint itself, found by running it rather than reading it.

The constraint is still right. What was missing is the answer to the only question the operator has
at that moment: *which playlist is using this one*. Delete now returns **409 naming the parents**
(`used_by`), and the list endpoint carries `used_by_count` / `has_children` so the UI can mark a
shared block **before** anyone tries to delete it.

That is BrightSign's lock-icon idea — *"a lock icon on an item indicates that it is being used in an
active presentation… and cannot be deleted"* — and it is the thing Appspace conspicuously lacks:
*"deleting content from a source affects every zone and channel linked to it"*, with no reverse view
and no confirmation.

#### ⚠️ Found by audit: nesting is a COLUMN, and twelve writers never heard about it

Phase 1 added `playlist_items.child_playlist_id` and guarded the one route that sets it. That was
not enough. `playlist_items` has **twelve writers across seven files**, and every one of them was
written when a row could only be content or a widget. Five of them handled a nested row wrongly, and
none of them failed — they returned 200 and quietly produced something else.

| Path | What it did | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `playlists.js` discard-draft | rebuilt from the FLAT `published_snapshot`, replacing the child reference with a snapshot-time **copy** of its contents | **data loss**, silent |
| `playlists.js` item swap (PUT) | set `content_id` without clearing `child_playlist_id` | **corrupt row** |
| `playlists.js` item duplicate | copied content/widget only → row with no content, no widget, no child | ghost item |
| `assignments.js` copy-to-device | same ghost, plus no depth check on the target | ghost + depth hole |
| `status.js` export/import | column absent from the export; import's `if (!contentId && !widgetId) continue` then **dropped** the row | silent shortening |

Two of these deserve to be remembered as shapes, not incidents:

**The snapshot is lossy about structure, and something was already restoring from it.**
`published_snapshot` is flat *by design* — that is the whole point of expanding at publish, so no
player has to understand nesting. Discard rebuilt the draft from it. So the flattening that makes
the feature safe for players is exactly what made "undo my changes" destroy the feature. The fix is
a second column, `playlists.published_structure`, holding the **pre-expansion** list; devices never
see it, and rows published before it existed fall back to the snapshot safely, because the column
and the feature shipped together.

**"Exactly one of content_id / widget_id ends up set" was a true comment that expired.** The swap
route says so in its own header. It was correct when there were two columns. Adding a third made the
sentence false, and nothing in the codebase re-read it. ⚠️ When a new column joins a mutually
exclusive set, grep for the *prose* describing the old set — not just the code.

The depth hole in copy-to-device is worth naming too: the add-path guard refuses to make a playlist
a child when it already has children, and refuses to give a child more children. Copying a whole
playlist *into* a device playlist that is itself used as a child bypasses both, because neither ever
runs. **A guard on the add path is not a guard on the invariant.** Bulk paths need their own.

### And the same shape, twice more, in a feature that already shipped

The audit was for nesting, but the pattern it looks for — *a column added later that only some
writers were taught about* — turned up #129's per-item mute doing exactly the same thing:

- **`routes/playlists.js` never read `muted` at all.** Its sibling on the device page
  (`routes/assignments.js`) handled it; here the field was accepted, dropped and answered 200. The
  dashboard's only mute toggle is on the device page, so nothing on a screen was wrong today — but
  this endpoint is public API surface, and a client muting through it got success and silence.
- **`discard` did not restore it**, so undoing an unrelated draft edit silently un-muted every item.
- **Muting an item inside a nested child never reached the parent.** `emitMuteChanged` patches the
  published snapshot surgically — but the parent holds a *flattened copy* of the child, so every
  screen playing the parent kept the old flag. Same tax `publishPlaylist` pays by republishing
  ancestors, unpaid in a second place.

The helper now lives in `server/lib/mute-sync.js`, shared by both routes and patching ancestors.

⚠️ **The generalisation worth keeping: flatten-at-publish creates a duty at every write, not just at
publish.** Any code that edits a *published* snapshot in place has to walk the ancestors too, and
there is nothing in the type system, the schema, or the tests that will remind the next author. When
adding such a path, grep for `child_playlist_id` before assuming one snapshot is the only copy.

Nine mutation tests pin all of this (`test/playlist-nesting.test.js`); reverting any single fix fails
exactly one of them.

## Deferred to phase 2 (cursored), deliberately

- the cursor itself (`play N per rotation`, advancing across parent loops)
- player-side nesting state, and the diff that preserves it
- per-placement property overrides (Scala's third state — content shared live, presentation settings
  copied per placement)
- daypart composition on the reference itself. **Phase 1 has no daypart on the reference at all**,
  which sidesteps the 4-way industry split entirely — the child's own item schedules are the only
  ones that apply, and they already work.

## What the industry agrees on

**Effective depth is 1.** Signagelive states it twice — *"Double nesting is not supported"* — and
every other reference-based implementation is one level through a layout. Only *copy*-based nesting
(BrightSign super states) goes deeper, precisely because copies cannot recurse.

**Nobody documents cycle detection. Six of six in the enterprise tier, and none elsewhere.** They
make cycles structurally unreachable instead:

- **by type** — MagicINFO's Nested playlist can only hold content, not playlists
- **by copy semantics** — BrightSign super states are embedded objects
- **by schema shape** — Carousel has no recursive edge at all

⚠️ Three vendors have a **latent indirect cycle** nobody documents: playlist → layout/slide/app →
zone → playlist. If we allow both nesting axes we inherit that, and we would be the only ones to
have noticed.

**The parent caps the block; it does not reach inside.** Five of six are explicit. Duration belongs
to the item at its placement. Xibo's `Spot Length` is the sole exception.

**Editing a child reaches every parent, live.** Nobody snapshots at attach time. The universal tell
is that deleting a child *damages* every parent — which copy semantics could not do.

## ⚠️ Where vendors genuinely disagree, and we must therefore choose

### Daypart composition — a real 4-way split

| Model | Vendors |
|---|---|
| **Intersect (AND)** — parent window AND child window; a parent daypart cannot *widen* a child's | Scala, Poppulo, Korbyt |
| **Per-dimension override with fall-through** — parent wins per dimension (validity / days / times independently), child fills the unset ones | Signagelive |
| **Undocumented** | Navori, 22Miles, and everyone in the other two tiers |

These produce **different content on screen for identical author input**. Signagelive has a
dedicated KB article for exactly this question — and its main nesting article still contradicts
itself on the answer. If a vendor with a dedicated article cannot keep it straight, neither will our
users.

**Proposed: intersect.** It is the majority, it is the only one that cannot surprise someone into
showing content outside a window they set, and it composes with the per-item schedule blocks we
already have. It must go into `shared/schedule-vectors.json` so both players are held to it.

### Temporal vs spatial — the deepest fork

Scala and Signagelive nest *in the loop*. Navori, Korbyt, 22Miles and Poppulo nest *into a region of
a layout*. The zone-based vendors literally cannot ask "which zone does this sub-playlist target",
because the answer is inherent in where it was placed.

⚠️ **Carousel's variant is the most elegant thing found in the whole survey**: they share the
**zone**, one level *below* the assignable object. Cycles, depth limits and resolution order all
stop existing. Worth weighing seriously against nesting proper before we build either.

## ⚠️ Restart-on-edit — the risk this feature actually carries

Our structural fingerprint restarts playback when it changes (`server/player/index.html`). A child
edit changes every parent's flattened items, so **editing a shared "corporate news" playlist would
restart every screen in the estate at item 1** — the #234 shape.

The industry confirms the fear and has *not* solved it well:

- **Navori — restarts by DEFAULT.** *"the currently running playlist resets itself and jumps back to
  its beginning."* The opt-out, **"No Media Interruption"**, is still only *apply-at-next-loop*, not
  a splice.
- **22Miles — restarted until `7.5.50416` (Apr 2025)**, fixed since — *"Don't restart when playlist
  updating"* — but **still restarts for layout and player-setting changes.**
- **BrightSign — resets `playbackIndex%` to `startIndex%`** on `CONTENT_DATA_FEED_LOADED`. Does not
  cut mid-item; the reset lands at the next item boundary.
- **Four vendors publish no continuity guarantee at all.**

**Three things to steal:**

1. ⭐ **Make the reset change-triggered, not poll-triggered.** BrightSign's mitigation already exists
   in the product: a `CONTENT_DATA_FEED_UNCHANGED` path driven by *"optimize feed updates (use HEAD
   calls)"* skips the repopulate entirely when nothing changed. Cheap change-detection is the whole
   fix for the common case.
2. ⭐ **The resume-vs-restart decision belongs in the PLAYER, not the manifest.** Carousel shipped
   our exact bug — CSL-9211, *"BrightSign players would restart a single bulletin playing in a zone
   **when a different zone's content changes**"* — and fixing it required a **player-app release**.
   Their `BulletinSpec.lastUpdate` per item is what makes the diff cheap. The player must diff
   incoming against currently-playing and preserve position per zone.
3. **Defer to the loop boundary.** Neither vendor that documented this implemented a true mid-loop
   splice. Apply-at-next-boundary is the pragmatic target, not a compromise.

Anthias is the honourable exception and the cleanest pattern: on a content change it skips *only*
the currently-displayed asset if it became invalid, and leaves the rest of the loop alone
(issue #2430 → PR #2875).

## Things that will bite us, taken from other people's scars

- ⚠️ **Deletions propagate silently.** Appspace red-boxes it: *"deleting content from a source
  affects every zone and channel linked to it"* — with no reverse-dependency view and no
  confirmation. **BrightSign's answer is cheap and better: a lock icon on any item used in an active
  presentation, which cannot be deleted.** Build the reverse index before shipping shared children.
- ⚠️ **Empty nested playlists cause hardware-specific black screens.** *"Three or more 'empty'
  nested playlists in succession… may fail to skip… Affected: Samsung Tizen, **BrightSign XD
  (8.5.47)**."* Vendor workaround is *"even if it's just a 1-second image"*. Directly relevant to
  our BrightSign work — we should refuse to publish an empty nested reference rather than ship one.
- ⚠️ **Scala's Full Screen / Audio Ducking OR across every level** — *"employed if the feature is set
  to On in **any applicable location**"*. A child cannot defend itself against a parent. A clean
  example of a property that must **not** inherit disjunctively; ours must not either.
- ⚠️ **Scala's placement-scoped properties are a third state most designs miss.** Content is shared
  live, but duration/transition/conditions are stored **per placement**: *"applies to the item only
  in that playlist."* We should decide this deliberately rather than discover it.
- ⚠️ **Scala's Manual plan-generation mode silently strands child edits** — a shared sub-playlist
  edit reaches zero screens until a human clicks Generate Plan. Any publish gate we add needs to
  make that state visible.

## What is NOT established, and should not be assumed

- **Restart-on-edit for Scala, Signagelive, Korbyt, Poppulo, MagicINFO, Appspace, LG, OptiSigns,
  Rise Vision.** All three agents exhausted their web-search budgets and lost forum access; this is
  the question vendors do not document and practitioners answer on forums. Answered only for
  Navori, 22Miles, BrightSign and Anthias.
- **Cycle detection anywhere.** Not "no limit found" — genuinely undocumented by all 17.
- **How a short parent cap interacts with a child cursor next rotation** (Signagelive).
- Navori's `ZonePlaylist.UponCompletion` appears in the API schema with **zero prose**; its value set
  would settle once-vs-loop-vs-hold.

## Open questions for the user

1. ~~Stateless or cursored?~~ **Settled 2026-08-23: stateless first, cursored later.**
2. ~~Depth cap and a real cycle error?~~ **Settled: yes** — depth 1, enforced by type, with a named
   error. Nobody else documents either.
3. **Still open — nest in the loop, or share a zone (Carousel's model)?** Phase 1 as specified nests
   in the loop. Carousel's zone-sharing makes cycles, depth limits and resolution order all
   disappear, and is worth a decision before phase 2 rather than after.
