# LG webOS Signage player

The webOS player is the browser player in an installed shell. `webos/` builds an `.ipk` that LG
signage panels install from a USB stick or an SI server; the app launches on boot, asks for the
server address once, then runs `https://<your-instance>/player` in a frame and hands it what a
page cannot do on its own through LG's SCAP library: reboot, screen off and on, and installing
its own updates.

## Install

1. Get `ScreenTinker.ipk` from the release page or from `https://<your-instance>/webos`.
2. Copy it to a USB stick, plug it into the panel, and install it from the panel's settings
   (the menu path varies by webOS version; on most it is under General, Install App). An SI
   server can push the same file to a fleet.
3. Launch ScreenTinker. Enter the server address with the remote and press Save. The pairing
   code appears; claim it in the dashboard.
4. Press Back on the remote at any time to return to the server screen.

Fleets can ship the address in the package instead: a `config.json` next to `appinfo.json`
with `{ "serverUrl": "https://signage.example.com" }` is used when nothing has been typed in.

## Self-update

The app fetches `/webos/version.json` on start and every six hours. When the server publishes a
newer version and the panel has the SCAP library, it downloads `/webos/ScreenTinker.ipk` and asks
the panel to upgrade itself. One attempt is made per published version. Without SCAP the app
stays at its installed version and a new `.ipk` is installed the way the first one was.

## Building

```
cd webos && ./build-ipk.sh
```

LG's `ares-package` is used when it is on `PATH` (`npm i -g @webos-tools/cli`); otherwise the
script assembles the same archive itself, which is what CI does for releases. The build stamps
the app version from `appinfo.json`, which `scripts/bump-version.sh` keeps in step with the
server.

**SCAP is not in the repository.** LG's licence does not allow redistributing the library, so
`webos/vendor/` is empty in the source tree and in the CI-built `.ipk`. Copy the SDK files
listed in `webos/vendor/README.md` into that directory before building to get power and update
controls; the dashboard hides those buttons for a panel whose app reports it cannot do them.

## What the panel has to support

The player uses modern JavaScript (optional chaining), which needs Chromium 80 or newer. That
is webOS Signage 22 and later. Older panels (webOS 3, 4 and 6) run older engines and will not
load the player until a transpiled build exists; that is the known follow-up.

## Not verified on hardware

Everything here was built against the SCAP 1.2 method names and the `ares-package` archive
layout, and packaged and unpacked on the build machine. No LG panel was available. The exact
local path `upgradeApplication` installs from, and the install menu path, are the two things
most likely to need adjusting after a first run on a real display.
