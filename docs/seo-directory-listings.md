# SEO: Off-Site Listings & Backlink Checklist

These are the **off-repo** SEO actions that can't be done in code — they need an account, a
form submission, or outreach. Every serious competitor (Yodeck, ScreenCloud, OptiSigns, Xibo,
Anthias) is listed across these; ScreenTinker currently is not. Each listing is both a
high-authority backlink and a surface that ranks for "best/free/open-source/alternative"
queries. Ordered by ROI.

## Tier 1 — highest ROI (do first)

- [ ] **Capterra** — https://www.capterra.com/vendors/sign-up · digital-signage category. The #1 review moat competitors have (Yodeck 4,700+ reviews). Claim/create the profile, then seed honest reviews from real users.
- [ ] **G2** — https://www.g2.com/products/new · ranks for "[competitor] alternatives". Create the product, request reviews.
- [ ] **AlternativeTo** — https://alternativeto.net/manage-item/ · submit ScreenTinker as an alternative to **Yodeck, ScreenCloud, OptiSigns, Xibo, Anthias/Screenly**. Tag: open source, self-hosted, free. This is where OSS-seekers browse.
- [ ] **awesome-selfhosted** — PR to https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted (Digital Signage / Media section). High-authority, high-intent backlink; Anthias/Xibo are there. ⚠️ **BLOCKED UNTIL ~2026-10-10.** PR #2392 was closed 2026-04-29 for their "first released more than 4 months ago" rule; first release is v1.8.0, 2026-06-10. Resubmitting early burns the second attempt, so do not.
- [ ] **fingoweb "Top open source digital signage" roundup** — pitch inclusion via their contact form (their article ranks #1 for several OSS queries and omits us). Highest-value single listicle.

## Tier 2 — directory saturation

- [ ] **SourceForge** — https://sourceforge.net/create/ (OSS directory, ranks for "open source digital signage").
- [ ] **GetApp** — https://www.getapp.com/ (Gartner network; often auto-generates "vs" pages).
- [ ] **Software Advice** — https://www.softwareadvice.com/ (Gartner network).
- [ ] **GoodFirms** — https://www.goodfirms.co/ (their "Top Free & Open Source" roundup ranks).
- [ ] **SoftwareSuggest / SaaSHub / Slashdot** — quick profile submissions.
- [ ] **Product Hunt** — a launch post (one-time spike + durable backlink).

## Tier 3 — community / organic signals

- [ ] **r/selfhosted** — a genuine "I built/self-host this" post (Anthias gets real traffic here). No spam; lead with the self-host story.
- [ ] **r/digitalsignage** — participate, link where relevant.
- [ ] **Hacker News (Show HN)** — "Show HN: ScreenTinker – open-source self-hosted digital signage."
- [x] **GitHub repo polish** (done) — topics/tags: `digital-signage`, `signage`, `self-hosted`, `open-source`, `cms`, `raspberry-pi`, `kiosk`, `android-tv`. Keyword-rich description + README (done). Stars are themselves a ranking signal (Anthias ranks partly because its repo does).
- [ ] **Roundup outreach** — signagespace.com, cenareo, nento, digitalsignagehub.org, softwaresuggest "15 best" — ask to be added.

## Notes

- **Do NOT fabricate reviews or ratings** — seed real ones from actual users only. Fake aggregateRating is a Google penalty risk (we already removed a fabricated one from the landing page).
- Reuse the exact same name/desc/logo everywhere for entity consistency (helps Google's Knowledge Graph).
- Re-run `scripts/indexnow-submit.sh` after the new pages deploy to prod so Bing/Yandex re-crawl immediately.
