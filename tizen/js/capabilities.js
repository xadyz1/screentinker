/* ScreenTinker — Tizen capability declaration.
 *
 * The dashboard used to offer every control to every display, so buttons a platform cannot honour
 * did nothing and read as bugs. The player now DECLARES what it can actually do
 * (server/lib/player-capabilities.js holds the vocabulary) and the frontend hides the rest.
 *
 * Declared at RUNTIME rather than from a static table, because on Tizen the answer genuinely
 * varies by build and panel:
 *   - reboot and real panel power exist only through webapis.systemcontrol / b2bapis.b2bcontrol,
 *     which are injected ONLY on a Samsung panel running a .wgt signed with a Partner distributor
 *     certificate. The same code on an unsigned dev build, the URL-Launcher path, or a consumer TV
 *     has no such surface (see device-control.js).
 *   - tizen.tvaudiocontrol is a TV-profile API; it is absent in a plain browser context.
 * A hardcoded list would claim these on every Tizen device and be wrong on most of them.
 *
 * ⚠️ Names must match server/lib/player-capabilities.js exactly. An unknown string is DROPPED by the
 * server's parser, so a typo silently removes a control rather than failing loudly.
