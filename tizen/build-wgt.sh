# SSSP URL-Launcher manifest. Host this + the .wgt in the SAME folder, then enter that folder's

# as "Unable to install. Please try again later." — an OM55B on Tizen 5.0 refused a 126929-byte
# build advertised as <size>126929</size>, and installed the identical file once the value read
# 124. Nothing in the failure names the size, let alone the unit. Rounded UP, and regenerate this
