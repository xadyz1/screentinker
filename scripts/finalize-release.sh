#   1. build the SIGNED Android APK locally,

#   3. assemble a COMPLETE source tarball that bundles BOTH binaries
#      (extract it and ScreenTinker.apk sits at the root, ready for /download/apk),

# without autorun-server.zip and server-payload.zip because CI never built them; alpha5's
# had to be built and uploaded by hand after the fact. CI builds them now, and this
# refuses to call a release done if any expected asset is absent.
#
# ⚠️ THE LIST IS EXPLICIT, NOT DERIVED. Deriving it from what is present would make the
# check agree with whatever happened, which is precisely the failure being guarded.
# Adding an artifact means adding it here, deliberately.
