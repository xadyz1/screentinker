# to 2.0.0, found it "behind", and refused a release that was perfectly fast-forward. The question
# is always "will pushing THIS branch fast-forward", so ask it about this branch.

# Best-effort: when the fetch can't run (offline), warn and proceed rather than block a local bump
# - the push itself is still the backstop.

# ⚠️ EVERY FILE STAMPED ABOVE MUST BE LISTED HERE. webos/appinfo.json was stamped at step 4b and

#    webos-player.test.js asserts that parity, which means the tagged commit failed its own test
#    suite and the release job never ran. A stamp that is not staged is worse than no stamp: the
#    working tree looks correct and only CI sees the truth.
#    js/app.js is stamped from appinfo.json by webos/build-ipk.sh, which the test suite runs, so it
#    is listed too and the tree stays clean after a test run.
