# Build brightsign/autorun-server.zip — what you drop on a player to make it a SERVER.
#
#   scripts/build-server-boot-zip.sh [-o path]
#
# ⚠️ THIS IS THE ONE TO SHIP. It carries only the four files needed to start; the ~71MB of server
# and node_modules arrives separately as server-payload.zip and is unpacked by Node. It was called
# autorun-boot.zip, which described how it is BUILT rather than what it is FOR — and the name
# autorun-server.zip sat on the all-in-one build, which is the package that cannot boot at all. The
# good name was on the artifact that does not work.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The full server package is ~73MB across 9,356 entries, and BrightSignOS cannot
# open it: the boot-time autorun scan reports
#
#     Failed to use zipped 'SSD:/autorun.zip': ZipArchive error at line 91
#
# and falls through to "Load or runtime error in autorun. Forcing recovery." Provisioning CAN unpack
# the same archive — the files land on disk — so the limit is specifically in the OS's own zip
# reader, not in the archive. Path lengths (max 182 chars) and depth (8) are well inside anything
# reasonable, which leaves size and entry count.
#
# So the OS gets an archive shaped exactly like the player package that already works on this
# hardware: a handful of small files, STORED, at the root. The ~71MB of server + node_modules is
# delivered separately and unpacked by Node, which has no such limit.
#
# This build is deliberately ALSO the isolation test: if the player boots this and shows
# "server payload not installed" on screen, the size hypothesis is confirmed and the two-stage
# design is right. If it still fails to open THIS, the problem is something else entirely and no
# amount of splitting would have helped.
