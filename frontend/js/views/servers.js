 * Servers — the connected servers themselves: their screens, the shape of the graph, and pairing.
 *
 * ⚠️ ALERTS AND THE UPTIME REPORT USED TO LIVE HERE AND DELIBERATELY DO NOT ANY MORE.
 *
 * A mesh-only alert inbox is a second place to look for one question — "what is wrong right now" —
 * and the moment there are two, the one an operator does not have open is the one with the answer.
 * Alerts belong on ONE screen that happens to include remote sites (Activity). The uptime report is
 * a report, and Reports is where somebody goes looking for one; filing it under Servers means you
 * have to already know the feature is mesh-shaped in order to find it.
 *
 * ⚠️ NODES ARE NOT SCREENS. A server is not a display and does not belong in the Displays list.
 * Remote DEVICES are a different matter — those now appear under their own org in the ordinary
 * Displays view, because to an operator a screen is a screen wherever it is plugged in.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY REMOTE ROW SHOWS ITS AGE. This screen reports on machines over links that fail
 * independently of them, so "online" without "as of when" is a claim the reader cannot check.
