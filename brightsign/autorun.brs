' ScreenTinker — BrightSign player host
'
' The ScreenTinker player itself is the ordinary web player (server/player/index.html) running
' in an roHtmlWidget. This script is the HOST around it, and it exists for the things a page
' cannot do for itself:
'
'   1. OWN THE WIDGET LIFECYCLE. A page that calls location.reload() on a BrightSign does not
'      reliably come back — observed in the field on 2026-07-28, where a ScreenTinker deploy
'      reloaded every connected player and the BrightSign was the only one that never returned.
'      So the page NEVER reloads itself here: it posts {type:"restart"} and this script tears the
'      widget down and builds a new one. That is a restart the OS actually performs.
'   2. SURVIVE A DEAD SERVER. load-error retries with backoff and falls back to a local page,
'      instead of leaving a white screen until someone power-cycles the box.
'   3. PERSIST IDENTITY across reboots and content changes, in the registry rather than in
'      localStorage (which is tied to the page's origin and its storage quota).
'   4. REACH BRIGHTSCRIPT-ONLY CAPABILITIES on the page's behalf — video mode, a second output,
'      and native BrightWall synchronisation — over the messageport bridge.
'
' Pair it with st-bridge.js, which is the JavaScript half of the same contract.

' SD card layout:  autorun.brs  st-bridge.js  offline.html  [screentinker.json]

'=== storage volume ==========================================================================
' WHERE we are running from is not a given. The obvious answer is the SD card, and every
' BrightSign example assumes it — but this player also boots FLASH:/autorun.brs straight out of
' internal eMMC, which is the ONLY path on a unit whose microSD interface is dead (ours has
' liquid corrosion on the card lines; the host controller probes at 400kHz and no card ever
' answers). Hard-coding "SD:" there means the script loads and then cannot find its own files.
'
' So ask the filesystem instead of assuming: whichever volume holds this script is the volume
' that holds everything else beside it.
Function StorageRoot() As String
    ' Which volume are we actually running from? Everything else is derived from this — the offline
    ' page, the widget's storage directory, the self-update paths — so getting it wrong points the
    ' whole player at a volume that may not physically exist.
    '
    ' Probed in the order the OS itself searches for an autorun script (roStorageHotplug.GetStorages()
    ' documents ["USB1:/", "SD:/", "SD2:/", "SSD:/", "FLASH:/"]), so the answer matches the volume the
    ' player actually booted from. FLASH is last because it is the fallback of last resort: the unit
    ' this was developed on has a dead card slot and boots from internal flash, and an earlier version
    ' of this function knew only FLASH and SD — so fitting real storage to that player and moving the
    ' files onto it would have silently resolved every path to "SD:", a slot with nothing in it.
    '

    ' and returns nothing when the pattern contains a separator, which is why the helper further down
    ' this file never finds anything.

'=== self-update ============================================================================
'
' The package (autorun.zip) can replace THIS SCRIPT. That makes it the most dangerous thing the
' player does: a truncated or half-applied autorun.brs is a dark panel and a site visit, because
' there is no app underneath to fall back to.
'
' The ordering below is the safety, and it is deliberate at every step:
'
'   1. Download to autorun.zip.part — never straight to autorun.zip. A file that is still
'      downloading, or that stopped halfway, must never be a candidate for extraction.
'   2. Verify sha256 AND size before promoting. A captive portal that answers with a login page
'      produces a perfectly well-formed small file; the size floor catches it, the hash catches
'      everything else.
'   3. Only then promote: delete the .done marker, rename .part -> autorun.zip, reboot.
'      The marker MUST go first — leaving it would make ApplyPendingPackage skip the new archive
'      on the next boot and the update would silently never happen.
'   4. Extraction failure renames the archive to .bad rather than retrying forever. A zip that
'      cannot be unpacked will not unpack on the tenth attempt either, and retrying it on every
'      boot is a loop that looks exactly like a hardware fault.
'
' THE VERSION IS BAKED IN, not stored in a side file. A version record that can disagree with the
' code actually running is the OTA-loop condition in another guise: the player applies an update,
' reports the old version, is offered it again, forever. Stamped at build time by both
