/*
 * ScreenTinker — BrightSign bridge (the JavaScript half of autorun.brs).
 *
 * Loaded by the web player only when it is running on a BrightSign. Everything here is a
 * capability the page cannot get on its own, plus one thing it must be STOPPED from doing:
 *
 *   - reload():  a page-initiated location.reload() does not reliably bring an roHtmlWidget
 *                back (a ScreenTinker deploy darkened a customer's player this way on
 *                2026-07-28). Ask the host to rebuild the widget instead.
 *   - identity:  the registry survives reboots, content updates and origin changes;
 *                localStorage does not. The hardware serial is the stable id, so two panels
 *                imaged from the same card never collide.
 *   - sync:      exposes which backend this deployment uses, so the player can run its own
 *                clock-derived group sync or defer to BrightSign's native BrightWall.
 *
 * Safe to load anywhere: if the @brightsign modules are absent (a desktop browser, or a widget
 * built without nodejs_enabled) every method degrades to a no-op or a sane default, and
 * isBrightSign() reports false. Nothing here may throw — this file loads before the player.
