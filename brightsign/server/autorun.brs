' ScreenTinker SERVER on a BrightSign player.
'
' TWO OBJECTS, TWO JOBS:
'   roNodeJs      - runs the server. A real Node process.
'   roHtmlWidget  - shows the diagnostic screen. Just a browser, pointed at a local page.
'
' ⚠️ THE SERVER USED TO LIVE INSIDE THE WIDGET, AND THAT COST FOUR BOOT FAILURES.
'
' A widget with nodejs_enabled is a Node context inside an Electron renderer, and it is NOT Node:
'
'   1. shebangs are not stripped, so any `#!/usr/bin/env node` file fails to compile with
'      "Failed to construct 'ContextifyScript': Invalid or unexpected token"
'   2. require() of an ESM-only package is unsupported, which plain Node 24 handles
'   3. setInterval is the DOM's - it returns a NUMBER, so `setInterval(...).unref()` throws
'   4. worker_threads cannot create a thread at all: "The V8 platform used by this instance of
'      Node does not support creating Workers"
'
' Every one of those is invisible to a test on a developer machine, because that test runs on real
' Node. BrightSign's own dev-cookbook is unambiguous about which object to use:
'
'   "Use roNodeJs if you need a long running background process or have more complex needs.
'    Use roHtmlWidget with Node.js enabled for browser-based apps."
'   "You can use this for long running processes like gathering metrics or running a web server."
'
' Their cra-template examples are exactly this shape - server in roNodeJs, widget pointed at
' localhost. A server is not a browser-based app.
'
' ⚠️ IT ALSO FIXES THE LIFECYCLE PROBLEM, which was the original objection to running a server on
' this hardware at all. In a widget the server shares the PAGE's life: a load error, a watchdog
' trip or a deploy tears it down mid-write, and an open SQLite WAL goes with it. roNodeJs "will run
' in the background uninterrupted".
'
' NO NATIVE CODE is involved either way: the server reaches SQLite through node:sqlite (built into
' the Node that BrightSignOS 10 ships) via server/db/sqlite-compat.js, so the same bundle runs on
' x86_64 and on this aarch64 player.
