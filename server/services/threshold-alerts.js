 * nothing, so "were my screens up last month, and what happened?" has never been answerable — there
 * is no record that an outage began or ended. Here an incident OPENS and later CLOSES, which makes
 * it a duration, and durations are what an uptime report is made of. The notification is a side
 * effect of the incident, not the other way round.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT MUST NEVER THROW INTO THE TICK. One device with odd telemetry, one rule referencing a metric
 * a newer build removed — neither may stop the other forty-nine rules from being evaluated. Every
 * per-device evaluation is wrapped for the same reason the mesh envelope handler is (I6, one tier
