     * two consequences. A server restart during an active schedule lost the Map, so the device was
     * stranded on the scheduled playlist FOREVER — nothing on the row recorded that it had been
     * temporary. And a schedule was indistinguishable from an operator's own choice, because both
     * ended up as the same column.
     *
     * With dedicated columns, "revert" is not "restore what I memorised" — it is "clear the
     * column", and the values a schedule used to clobber were never written over in the first
     * place. That makes every tick idempotent and the whole thing self-healing across a restart:
     * the next evaluation simply re-derives whether a schedule is active.
     *
     * Resolution order lives in the view (lib/playlist-resolver-sql.js), where scheduled_playlist_id
     * sits ABOVE the device's own — a schedule is meant to win while it runs, and only while it runs.
