         * fault, not a malformed edge, and this handler once turned exactly that into one warn line
         * per edge while the entire mesh sat inert — no telemetry, no reads, no writes, and a suite
         * of 2,300 tests still green. Isolation is right; hiding the difference between "this row is
         * bad" and "this build is broken" is not. The stack goes in the log, and the message says
         * what is actually not happening.
