// Activation nudge (Slice 3): a once-per-user "checking in" email sent T+3 days
// after signup when the user still has zero paired screens. Daily sweep at a
// fixed UTC hour. Reuses the single Microsoft Graph transport (./email).
//
// GATING — positive hosted signal, NOT !selfHosted:
//   This is a daily BULK sweep. A self-hoster who configured Graph but forgot
//   SELF_HOSTED=true would blast their whole dormant user base with Dan-branded
//   onboarding mail. So we gate on an explicit HOSTED_INSTANCE=true: if it's not
//   set, we neither schedule nor send. Hosted prod sets the env var.
//
// Idempotency: users.activation_nudge_sent_at, stamped after each send; the
// query's "IS NULL" guard means a user is nudged at most once. Re-runs are safe.
//
// Opt-out: users who explicitly turned email alerts off (email_alerts = 0) are
// excluded; NULL/unset and on (1) both qualify via COALESCE(...,1)=1.

You signed up for SwiftDisplay a few days ago, and I noticed you
haven't paired a screen yet. No worries at all. I just wanted to
check in and see if anything's getting in the way.

If you hit a snag, hit reply and tell me what happened. It comes
straight to me and I'll help you sort it.

If you just haven't had a chance yet, the fastest way to start is the
web player. Turn any browser into a screen in about a minute:

  -> ${LINKS.player}

Or if you're setting up real hardware:
  - Raspberry Pi: ${LINKS.pi}
  - Android TV:   ${LINKS.androidTv}
  - Self-hosted:  ${LINKS.selfHosted}

And the Discord is here if you'd rather ask there:
  ${LINKS.discord}

And if you'd rather I didn't check in, just say the word.

- Dan
