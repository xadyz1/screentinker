 * The driver choice, and the thing that choice is supposed to protect: that BOTH drivers behave the
 * same way for the SQL this server actually issues.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The player package used to be manufactured by the packager, which
 * dropped better-sqlite3 and installed db/sqlite-compat.js into node_modules under that name. The
 * result was an artifact whose database layer no test had ever run — the same shape as the
 * TELEMETRY_COLLECTOR crash that took production down with 1676 tests green. Choosing at runtime is
 * only an improvement if the second choice is exercised, so these run the built-in driver on an
 * ordinary developer machine via ST_SQLITE_DRIVER=node.
 *
 * Each case runs in a CHILD PROCESS. The driver decides once at require time and caches on the
 * module registry, so two selections cannot coexist in one process, and clearing require.cache would
 * leave the previous native binding loaded anyway.

 * the built-in-driver cases SKIP there rather than fail - a skip says "not checked here", which is

 *
 * The fallback is genuinely exercised by the separate Node 24 CI job that runs this whole suite with
