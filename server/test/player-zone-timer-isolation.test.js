/*
 * A second rotation must not have its advance timer cancelled by a layout change.
 *
 * showZoneItem() is the player's scoped rotation engine: its own container, its own item list, its
 * own keyed timer, advancing on duration or video-end. A multi-zone layout runs several of them at
 * once, and the triggers work (docs/triggers-design.md) runs one more inside #pipContainer.
 *
 * ⚠️ Every one of them used to key into the SAME module-level `zoneTimers` map, and renderZones()
 * begins with clearZoneTimers(), which wipes that map wholesale. So an unrelated layout change
 * silently cancelled any other rotation's pending advance — no throw, no log, the rotation simply
 * stopped advancing and sat on whatever item it had reached. That is the worst shape of bug this
 * player can have: something stops moving and nothing anywhere says why.
 *
 * `timers` is now a parameter defaulting to zoneTimers, so an independent rotation passes its own
 * store and clearZoneTimers() cannot reach it.
