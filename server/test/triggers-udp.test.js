/*
 * The UDP transport, EXECUTED against real sockets. docs/triggers-design.md §3.
 *
 * ⚠️ The claim being tested is that unicast, subnet broadcast and multicast are ONE socket and one
 * code path, not three. A structural reading cannot establish that; sending three genuinely
 * different kinds of datagram at one bind and watching all three arrive can.
 *
 * ⚠️ And the rejoin is the part with real field risk. A switch doing IGMP snooping stops forwarding
 * a group when it misses a membership report, and NOTHING on the host looks wrong — the socket is
 * bound, the membership is still held locally, datagrams just stop. Calling addMembership() again
 * when already a member returns EADDRINUSE and emits no fresh report, so the obvious "re-add on a
 * timer" is a no-op against the exact failure it was written for. Drop-then-add is what puts a real
 * report on the wire, and that is asserted here.
