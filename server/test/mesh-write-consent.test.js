 * ⚠️ THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT: `mesh_edges.grant_categories` is authored by the PARENT.
 * It mints a pairing code naming what the code grants, and the child stores that answer verbatim.
 * For reads that is defensible — every read category is read-only by construction. Carried to
 * writes it inverts the model completely: the parent writes its own permission into the child's
 * database, and the child then enforces it faithfully. That is worse than no enforcement, because
 * the child's own consent view would look correct while being false.
 *
 * So write lives in its own columns, written by exactly one route, which is authenticated on the
