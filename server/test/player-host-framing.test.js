/*
 * Framing headers when this server IS the display it serves.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE BUG THIS PINS. A BrightSign hosting ScreenTinker shows a local page from
 * `file:///ssd:/node-server.html` that layers the player in an iframe. helmet sets
 * X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN, file:// is not the same origin as http://127.0.0.1:8181, and the
 * result was a BLACK SCREEN on real hardware while every asset inside the frame returned 200 — the
 * player page, its six scripts, all fine, nothing in any log. Only the response headers said why.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT IS NOT JUST /player. Chrome evaluates SAMEORIGIN against the TOP-LEVEL document rather
 * than the immediate parent, so with a file:// page at the top, every iframe the player itself uses
 * — widget renders, kiosk views — is blocked by the same rule one level deeper. A fix scoped to
 * /player would have cleared the black screen and left every widget in the playlist black instead.
 * That is why the test below checks a widget-render path too, not only the player.
 *
 * The exception must stay narrow: player-host mode only, loopback only. A normal server must keep
 * SAMEORIGIN, or this "fix" is a clickjacking regression for every hosted install.
