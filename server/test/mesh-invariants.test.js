  /*
   * ⚠️ THIS WAS A NAME BLOCKLIST AND IT DID NOT GUARD WHAT IT CLAIMED.
   *
   * The old regex forbade mesh:(command|exec|reboot|push|apply|set). It did NOT match `mesh:write`,
   * `mesh:content` or `mesh:mutate` — so the invariant named in ARCHITECTURE.md could have been
   * removed by anyone who picked a different verb, and the guard would have stayed green. It also
   * read only lib/mesh/, never ws/meshSocket.js, which is the file that actually emits downward.
   *
   * A blocklist of names cannot express "no downward control": it expresses "not these six words".
   * So it is now an ALLOWLIST. Every downward handler must be named here, and adding one is a
   * deliberate edit to this list with a reason — which is exactly the review the invariant wants.
   *
   * I2 itself has moved twice and the honest statement is no longer "upward only":
   *   - reads (Phase 3) made the parent able to ASK. See lib/mesh/read-proxy.js.
   *   - writes (Phase 5) make it able to ASK for a change.
   * What must remain true, and what this test now protects, is that EVERY downward message is
   * answered by an allowlist on the child, keyed to a grant the child's own operator chose. The
   * parent may ask; it may never tell.
   */
  /*
   * ⚠️ EDITING THIS LIST IS THE REVIEW. Each entry is a thing a parent may cause to happen on a
   * child, and each one must be answered by a grant check on the child:
   *
   *   mesh:hello  — the parent announces its batching limits. Carries no request and changes
   *                 nothing; the child may ignore it entirely and does when there is no overlap.
   *   mesh:read   — "may I see X?" Answered by lib/mesh/read-proxy.js: segment-exact allowlist,
   *                 method pinned to GET, per-rule grant, workspace scope applied on the child.
   *   mesh:write  — "may I change X?" Answered by lib/mesh/write-proxy.js + node-write.js: its own
   *                 allowlist with the method pinned per rule, a write grant the CHILD's operator
   *                 set (never one that arrived over the wire), and the target's workspace resolved
   *                 from the child's own rows rather than taken from the request.
   *
   *   mesh:content-offer — "may I send you these files?" Answered by lib/mesh/content-receive.js.
   *                 The message carries a DESCRIPTION and a one-time ticket per file; it carries no
   *                 bytes and no location. The child then decides, against its own rows and its own
   *                 disk, in this order: does the content-push grant cover the named workspace
   *                 (grants.writeAllows, refusing an empty scope as firmly as an empty grant); does
   *                 it actually need any of it (checking the DISK, not just its content rows); does
   *                 the operator's byte allowance and the real free space both permit it — all
   *                 before a single byte is requested.
   *
   *                 ⚠️ The URL it fetches from is the child's OWN stored peer_url, never anything
   *                 in the message. A parent able to name the host would be a parent able to point
   *                 this node at anything on its network and have it download the result, and it
   *                 would look exactly like an ordinary content push (I7).
   *
   *                 ⚠️ Every arrived file is verified before it is visible: size from statSync, the
   *                 digest, and a re-sniff of the type — a parent is an authenticated remote writer
   *                 running a version we do not control.
   *
   *   mesh:content-purge — "please forget what I sent you." The ONLY downward message that removes
   *                 anything, and the narrowest one here. Answered by lib/mesh/relay.js: the ids
   *                 are matched against provenance rows for THIS edge's peer, so a parent can reach
   *                 what it sent and nothing else — not what the child uploaded, not what another
   *                 parent sent. Anything a playlist here still uses is REFUSED and reported,
   *                 because a file pulled out from under a published playlist is a blank slot on a
