/*
 * #299 stranded-play repair: once per CONNECTION, never once per play.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS TEST EXISTS, IN NUMBERS. The repair is a correlated self-join of play_logs against
 * play_logs plus a join to content, grouped per row, over the device's whole history. Measured
 * against a copy of a real fleet database — 3.1M rows, 2.7M on the busiest device — it costs
 * **362ms**, and **355ms when there is nothing to close**: the full price is paid whether or not it
 * finds anything. It was called on every play_start, and at roughly one play per second across a
 * 78-panel site that is a ~150ms synchronous block about once a second, permanently.
 *
 * That is not a theory. A 60-second CPU profile from the affected server put **27.1% of all wall
 * time** inside this single call, and it is the whole explanation for a loop whose p50 sat at the
 * 20ms measurement floor while its p99 sat at 130-165ms.
 *
 * A lost play_end comes from a session ending abruptly. The evidence for one is the FIRST play of a
 * NEW connection — inside a healthy session every end arrives normally. So the sweep is armed per
 * socket and disarmed once it runs.
