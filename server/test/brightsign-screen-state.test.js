// What a BrightSign shows: the server's own diagnostics, or the player.
//
// The box is both server and player, so the screen has to be one or the other at any moment, and
// the interesting part is the transitions:
//
//   - a fresh install has nothing to play and nobody to play it for, so it must show the address
//     where the first account gets created. There is no keyboard on a player; hiding that address
//     leaves the device unsetuppable.
//   - once an account exists it should get out of the way and be a screen.
//   - if the server later fails, the diagnostics must come BACK, or a black display is the only
//     symptom of a server that died overnight.
//
// That last requirement is why the player is an iframe layer rather than a navigation: navigating
// would replace the document and kill the poller that notices the failure.
//
// The decision lives in node-server.html, which ships in autorun.zip and cannot be imported. It is
// written as one pure function so the table below can pin it; the test lifts that function out of
// the page rather than restating it, so a change to the page is a change to what is tested.
