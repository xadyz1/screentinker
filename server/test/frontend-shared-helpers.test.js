/*
 * A shared helper a view CALLS must be a helper that view IMPORTS.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS SHIPPED, AND IT SHIPPED FOR SIXTEEN DAYS. The escaping sweep of 2026-08-11 added esc()
 * to three sinks in views/widgets.js and imported it in none of them. Every one of those lines
 * threw ReferenceError the instant it ran:
 *
 *   - the image picker died before appending itself, so "+ Add Background Image" and "Choose Logo"
 *     on a directory board did NOTHING AT ALL — which is what the report of "someone couldn't
 *     upload a background picture" actually was;
 *   - the Weather and Social config forms threw while building their HTML, so neither widget could
 *     be opened for editing.
 *
 * Nothing saw it. A syntax check passes — the reference is only resolved when the line runs. Every
 * view still rendered, because the calls sit inside click handlers. The unit suite was green,
 * 2600 tests of it, and so was the browser smoke, which never opened those particular dialogs.
 *
 * This is the cheapest thing that would have caught it: the shared helpers are a small, known set,
 * and asking whether a file that uses one has actually imported it costs nothing.
