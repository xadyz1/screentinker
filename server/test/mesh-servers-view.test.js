 * after the workspace routes and silently never fired — and the mesh routers were then added above
 * the corrected position and inherited the identical bug. The result: nothing mesh-related was ever
 * written to activity_log. Not granting another server the right to change your screens, not
 * revoking it, not minting a pairing code, not severing a link.
 *
 * Asserted rather than commented, because a comment saying "mount this first" is exactly what
 * failed twice. This is an ordering property of one file, so it is checked as one.
