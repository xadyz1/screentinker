/*
 * `device_groups.priority` — the precedence column for a device in MORE THAN ONE group.
 *
 * ⚠️ The column WAS inert when this file was written; it is not any more. `device_resolved_playlist`
 * orders groups by `priority DESC, created_at ASC`, so this is now the tiebreak that decides what a
 * multi-group device plays. These tests still pin the column's CONTRACT — default, nullability,
 * ordering — while the resolver's behaviour is covered in test/playlist-inheritance.test.js.
 *
 * It mirrors `schedules.priority` on purpose. The two inheritance systems used to disagree —
 * schedules resolved lazily with a stated rule, playlists were copied eagerly with none — and
 * matching the column is part of what closed that gap. See docs/playlist-inheritance-design.md.
