/*
 * #313 — a display that can be identified from its URL, for players whose storage does not survive.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE REPORT. A vMix browser input deletes its entire CEF profile when vMix closes — vMix's own
 * staff, on their forum: "The Web Browser input cache is automatically cleared when closing vMix".
 * localStorage, cookies and IndexedDB go together, so the web player comes back with nothing at
 * all. Nothing is worse than it sounds: a player with no identity PROVISIONS A NEW DISPLAY ROW, so
 * every restart of the production PC left a fresh unpaired screen and the operator's dashboard
 * filled with corpses.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS FILE IS REALLY GUARDING, and it is not the happy path. It is that the exchange
 * happens at the door and changes nothing behind it: a key resolves to device_id + device_token
 * and then the ordinary register path runs. The two failure modes that would matter are a bad key
 * falling through to provisioning (a new row per restart — the very bug), and a key overriding a
 * player that already knows who it is (a working screen silently re-pointed by editing its URL).
