/*
 * WHICH SQLite driver this process uses, decided at RUNTIME.
 *
 * There are two: the native `better-sqlite3`, and `./sqlite-compat.js` — a better-sqlite3-shaped
 * façade over Node's built-in `node:sqlite`. Both work; they differ in what they need from the host.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The BrightSign player package used to be MANUFACTURED: the packager dropped
 * better-sqlite3 from package.json and then installed the shim into node_modules under the name
 * `better-sqlite3`, so every require resolved to it by construction. That worked, and it shipped a
 * code path CI had never executed — the same shape as the TELEMETRY_COLLECTOR TDZ crash that took
 * production down while 1676 tests were green. A build-time rewrite cannot be tested by the build it
 * rewrites.
 *
 * Deciding at runtime instead means ONE artifact, and both paths are reachable from a test:
 * ST_SQLITE_DRIVER=node runs the whole suite on the built-in driver, on an ordinary developer
 * machine, with no player involved.
 *
 * ⚠️ CONSTRUCT A DATABASE, do not merely require it. better-sqlite3's entry point is plain
 * JavaScript that loads its compiled .node binding LAZILY, so `require()` succeeds under a Node
 * whose ABI the binary was never built for. Opening an in-memory database is what actually pulls the
 * binding in — this is the same reasoning as lib/preflight-deps.js, learned from a real Node 18/20
 * mismatch that reported a broken install as healthy.
 *
 * ⚠️ FALLING BACK IS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT. On a server that is SUPPOSED to have the native module, a
 * silent downgrade would hide a broken install behind slightly different behaviour — so
 * ST_SQLITE_DRIVER=better-sqlite3 makes the failure loud instead. The default is to fall back,
 * because the alternative on a player is a server that will not boot at all.
