 * real code once it reached a screen — the operator could not tell a working code from a broken one
 * until the poster was on a wall. The designer this feature replaces did exactly that: its QR was a
 * box with the word "QR" in it, and generateInnerHTML has no `qr` case at all, so the element
 * vanished entirely from the published widget.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT CALLS THE RENDERER'S OWN DRAWING CODE. A second QR implementation in the browser would
 * be a second thing to keep in step, and the failure — a preview that scans and a slide that does
 * not, or the reverse — is invisible on the machine that authored it.
 *
 * ⚠️ RETURNED AS JSON, NOT AS image/svg+xml. Serving an SVG document from the dashboard's own
 * origin is a category of thing worth not starting: an SVG loaded as a document can carry script,
 * and the fact that THIS one is generated and carries no operator text is a property of today's
 * code rather than of the content type. The editor base64s it into a data: URL for an <img>, which
