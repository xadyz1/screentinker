   * child that itself holds a child), not by traversing here. A→B→A therefore cannot be
   * constructed, so there is no cycle to detect at expansion time. This mirrors how MagicINFO does
   * it — by type rather than by traversal — because a checker that runs at publish is a checker
   * that can be reached with data already in the database.
   *
   * The `depth` guard below is belt-and-braces against a row written by some other path (an
   * import, a migration, a manual fix-up). It is not the primary defence and must not become it.
