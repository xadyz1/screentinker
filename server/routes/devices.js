 * rows that never use one. An operator asks for it on the screen that needs it.
 *
 * POST mints or ROLLS it — the same call, because rolling is the recovery when a URL leaks, and an
 * operator reaching for it is not in the mood to hunt for a second button. The old URL stops
 * working at the display's next connect.

 * ⚠️ FULL SCOPE TO MINT, for the same reason the trigger secret needs it — and more so.
 *
 * The default gate is method-based: anything that is not a GET needs only `write`. 2.0.3 stopped an
 * API token from READING an enrolment key off a device, on the grounds that the key lets its holder
 * BE that screen — register as it, take its playlist and its commands, report as it. Leaving the
 * MINT ungated handed the same power back through a different door: a write-scoped integration
 * could roll a key for any display in reach and then adopt that display's identity with it. Revoke
 * is gated for the mirror reason — it is the vMix display's only way back, and taking it away is a
 * denial of service on a screen the token was never given control of.
