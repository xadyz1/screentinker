/*
 * Enrollment: the flow that actually connects two servers.
 *
 * Phase 1 built pairing, validation, transport and storage as modules and tested them thoroughly —
 * but nothing ever called them from an HTTP surface, and nothing constructed an Uplink. The pieces
 * all worked and there was no way for an operator to reach any of them, which is not "complete".
 *
 * ⚠️ THE GRANT IS CHOSEN AT MINT TIME, BY THE SIDE GIVING THE DATA. The hub operator, already
 * authenticated here, decides what a code will grant before it is handed over. Letting the redeeming
 * node ask for its own grant would make enrollment a self-service permission escalation: whoever
 * holds a code could request everything, and the only thing standing between a client's content
 * library and a stranger would be a five-minute expiry.
 *
 * ⚠️ REDEMPTION IS THE ONE UNAUTHENTICATED ROUTE, and the code IS the credential. That is deliberate
 * and it is why the code is CSPRNG, single-use, short-lived, and burned inside the same transaction
 * that creates the edge. A child enrolling has no account on the parent and never will — it is a
 * machine, not a user.

 * sharing an admin login instead, which is worse.
 *
 * The blast radius is bounded by the scope check below: whatever they pair, only workspaces they
 * administer travel up, and "all workspaces" stays the instance owner's alone.
 *

 * address the user typed, so a workspace admin can now cause outbound connections from inside the
 * network. normalizeParentUrl() constrains the scheme and rejects embedded credentials, but it does
 * not and cannot restrict the host — an operator's own hub is frequently on a private address, so a
 * blocklist would break the main use case. Worth an allowlist if this is ever exposed to

     * ⚠️ THE WRITE GRANT GOES WITH IT. Severing used to null only the token, leaving write_grant,
     * write_scope and write_bytes_budget on the row — and the enrolment upsert sets revoked_at =
     * NULL on conflict, so re-pairing the same peer silently RESTORED write access to workspaces
     * the operator had chosen months earlier, while the response cheerfully reported
     * `writeGrant: []` and "the connection was made read-only".
     *
     * The partial-revoke path already clears all three and says why: so a later re-grant cannot
     * inherit an old choice. Severing is the stronger act and had the weaker cleanup. The note in
     * the enrolment path claiming re-pairing cannot widen a grant was true only for an edge that
     * had never been revoked; against a revoked one, un-revoking IS the widening.
     *
     * write_bytes_used is deliberately left alone — it is a record of what is still stored here,
     * not a permission, and zeroing it would lose track of bytes that are still on the disk.
