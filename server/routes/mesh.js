   * ⚠️ SEND THE SAME CONTENT TO SEVERAL CLIENTS AT ONCE.

   * The real shape of this job: an MSP has one campaign and forty sites, and doing that one node at
   * a time is forty trips through a UI plus keeping track of which ones took it. Nothing about it
   * needs new permission — the content belongs to this operator, and every client on the list has
   * already granted them content-push individually. This is a loop over a decision each customer
   * already made, not a new power.
   *
   * ⚠️ IT IS NOT A RELAY, and the distinction is worth keeping straight. Each child still fetches
   * from THIS node; nothing is cached in between, no third party holds anybody's bytes, and each
   * child's own grant is checked on arrival exactly as it is for a single push. The relay tier —
   * where an intermediate node stores and serves a subtree — is a different feature with an
   * unresolved consent question, and is documented in docs/mesh-relay-design.md rather than built.
   *
   * ⚠️ Bounded concurrency, not one big Promise.all. A push holds its acknowledgement open until
   * the child has finished fetching, so forty at once is forty long-lived sockets and forty
   * simultaneous transfers out of one uplink — which is how a hub saturates its own connection and
   * makes every one of them slower. Four at a time keeps the link usable and the wall-clock sane.
