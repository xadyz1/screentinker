// SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the API router partition.
//
// server.js mounts from these two lists; test/api.test.js (the partition firewall
// test) asserts against the SAME lists. Because both read this one file, the mount
// list and the test cannot drift: add a router to PUBLIC_ROUTERS and it gets the
// token front door AND the firewall test covers it; the day a JWT-only router stops
// returning 401 to a `Bearer st_` token (e.g. someone gives it the token door), CI
// fails. This is the firewall-rule-as-code.
//
//   PUBLIC_ROUTERS   - token-reachable. Mounted with the bearerAuth front door +
//                      resolveTenancy + tokenScopeGate. A scoped API token AND a JWT
//                      session both reach these.
//   JWT_ONLY_ROUTERS - requireAuth only (no token front door). A `Bearer st_` token
//                      fails jwt.verify -> 401, so these are unreachable by any token
//                      (secure by exclusion). Privileged surfaces live here.
//
// Per-entry flags:
//   renderBypass: also exposes a public GET /:id/render (device render) that skips auth.
//   tenancy:      JWT-only router also runs resolveTenancy (acts on the caller's active
//                 workspace). Routers without it target a workspace by URL/body param
//                 and are gated per-handler (e.g. canAdminWorkspace).
