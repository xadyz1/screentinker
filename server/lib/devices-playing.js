/*
 * "Which devices are actually playing X?" — in ONE place.
 *
 * ⚠️ This question has been got wrong five separate times, always the same way: a hand-written
 * `JOIN playlist_items pi ON pi.playlist_id = d.playlist_id`. There is even a comment in
 * routes/playlists.js noting it was "the THIRD time this exact shape has bitten" — sitting directly
 * above a fourth instance of it. A fan-out that forgets a case is the recurring bug in this
 * codebase, so this is a shared helper rather than a sixth thing to remember.
 *
 * Two cases every caller must handle and most did not:
 *
 * 1. **Inheritance.** devices.playlist_id is NULL for a screen that inherits from its group or
 *    wall — the copies were removed when the resolver landed. Joining on the raw column silently
 *    skips exactly those screens, so a widget edit or a replaced video never reaches them.
 *
 * 2. **Nesting.** A playlist's rows hold a CHILD REFERENCE, not the child's items. A widget or a
 *    content file living inside a nested playlist does not appear in the parent's playlist_items at
 *    all, even though the parent's flattened snapshot plays it. Depth is capped at 1
 *    (MAX_NEST_DEPTH), so one hop is exhaustive.

/*
 * Shared shape: devices whose resolved playlist contains `column = ?`, directly or one level down —
 * plus devices that can only reach it through a TRIGGER.
 *
 * ⚠️ The trigger case is the third one every hand-written version forgot. A device whose trigger
 * targets a playlist plays that playlist's items when the trigger fires, so it is showing this
 * widget or this file even though its base playlist has never mentioned either. pushToDevices in
 * routes/playlists.js already learned this the hard way; there is no reason for the widget and
 * content pushes to learn it separately.
