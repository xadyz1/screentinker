/*
 * Per-item mute, kept in sync with what devices actually play. Extracted from routes/assignments.js
 * so the playlist-page route can share it — that route had no mute handling at all, so the toggle
 * worked from the device page and was silently dropped from the playlist page. Same bug as #129,
 * one route over.
 *
 * #129 + mute-fix: per-item mute has to do TWO things, because the device plays from
 * playlists.published_snapshot (deviceSocket.buildPlaylistPayload), NOT the draft playlist_items
 * the toggle writes:
 *   (1) LIVE — tell every device on this playlist to silence the matching currently-playing item
 *       NOW (device matches by content_id/widget_id). Mutes the in-progress playthrough.
 *   (2) PERSIST — patch the matching item's `muted` inside the published_snapshot the device
 *       actually plays, then re-push. Without this the snapshot kept muted=0, so every loop/reload
 *       re-applied full volume — the "icon red but audio plays across 3 playthroughs" bug (Android
 *       re-loads each loop; web's native <video> loop masked it).
 *
 * The snapshot is patched SURGICALLY (just the muted field of matching items) rather than by
 * calling publishPlaylist, so a mute toggle can't prematurely publish other pending draft edits or
 * flip the playlist's draft/published status. muted is written as 0/1 to match buildSnapshotItems'
 * format (the player reads it via optInt). playlist_items.muted is still updated by the caller, so
 * a later full publish stays consistent.
 *
 * ⚠️ (3) ANCESTORS — added with playlist nesting. A parent's snapshot holds a flattened COPY of the
 * child's items, so muting an item inside a nested playlist patched the child's snapshot and left
 * every parent playing the old flag. This is the same tax publishPlaylist pays by republishing
 * ancestors; it has to be paid here too, or mute is silently a no-op for any screen on the parent.
 * Depth is capped at 1, so this is one hop and cannot recurse.
