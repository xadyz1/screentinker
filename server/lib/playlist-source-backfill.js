/*
 * Backfill devices.playlist_source.
 *
 * Pure logic, no boot concerns, so it can be unit-tested against an in-memory DB — the same split
 * as lib/tenant-cascade-migration.js.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CONTRACT: after this runs, every device must resolve to EXACTLY the playlist_id it had
 * before. Not "almost every" and not "the right one" — the same one. The player restarts playback
 * at item 1 whenever its structural fingerprint changes, so a migration that re-resolves even a
 * handful of devices is an estate-wide restart during an upgrade (the #234 shape). That property,
 * not correctness of the new model, is what this function is for.
 *
 * playlist_id alone cannot say whether it was CHOSEN or COPIED, so the value is classified by
 * comparing it against what the new resolver would inherit:
 *
 *   playlist_id IS NULL, and nothing would be inherited  -> NULL   (inherits; still plays nothing)
 *   playlist_id IS NULL, but something WOULD be inherited-> 'none' (explicitly plays nothing)
 *   playlist_id == the inherited value                   -> NULL   (it was a copy; keeps inheriting)
 *   playlist_id != the inherited value                   -> 'device' (someone chose it; an override)
 *
 * The 'none' case is the one that is easy to get wrong. Those devices are in a group that has a
 * playlist but hold no playlist of their own — usually because routes/devices.js "clear" wrote
 * playlist_id = NULL, which is exactly the bug the new model fixes. Letting them simply inherit
 * would light up screens that are dark today. Correct, arguably desirable, and still a change to
 * what is on a wall during an upgrade — so it is recorded as a deliberate "plays nothing" that an
 * operator can revert, rather than applied to them silently.
