/*
 * ⚠️ WHAT ANOTHER SERVER MAY SEND — A SUBSET, AND THE CONSENT TEXT IS WHY.
 *
 * The device-command grant says, in the words the customer reads before ticking it: "Reboot,
 * reload, change settings on screens." It does not say "and run shell commands on them, and install
 * software from a URL." Allowlisting the full command set under that sentence would make the
 * consent screen a lie — and a consent screen that overstates what it grants is worse than no
 * consent screen, because it is believed.
 *
 * So the mesh gets the commands the sentence actually describes. Excluded, deliberately:
 *
 *   shell, install_apk    — remote code execution and remote software installation. Nobody grants
 *                           these by ticking a box that says "reboot and change settings", and no
 *                           wording would make them a reasonable default for a third party.
 *   power_menu, lock_now, kiosk_lock, kiosk_unlock, block_uninstall, unblock_uninstall
 *                         — device-owner controls. These change what the person STANDING AT the
 *                           panel can do, which is a different kind of power from changing what it
 *                           displays, and it belongs to whoever owns the hardware.
 *   update                — triggers an OTA install. A hub deciding when a customer's estate takes
 *                           new software is a scheduling decision with an outage attached, and the
 *                           OTA machinery already has its own opt-in per display.
 *
 * ⚠️ If this list ever grows, the consequence text in lib/mesh/grants.js grows with it, in the same
 * commit. That pairing is the entire point.
