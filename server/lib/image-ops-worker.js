 * Worker-thread host for image-ops-core. One job per message, one reply per job, keyed by id.
 *
 * Deliberately thin: every decision (queueing, lifecycle, fallback) lives in ../lib/image-ops so
 * there is one place to reason about them. This end only does the work and reports what happened.
 *
 * Errors come back as a message rather than a thrown exception, so one undecodable upload does
 * not tear down the worker and take the queued jobs of unrelated callers with it.
