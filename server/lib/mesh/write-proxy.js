 * Exactly what a parent may CHANGE on this node, and nothing else.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE FROM read-proxy.js ON PURPOSE. There is a test that greps read-proxy
 * for HTTP verbs and asserts none appear — `!== 'GET'` is present, `'POST':` is not. That guard is
 * worth keeping exactly as it is: the read surface should stay provably read-only, and mixing
 * writes into it would delete a property in order to add a feature.
 *
 * The shape mirrors READABLE deliberately — an exact path, the grant it needs, and matching that is
 * segment-exact — because the failure modes are the same ones and the read proxy already learned
 * them. What differs is that a write rule also pins its METHOD, and that authorization has a second
 * axis: the workspace. A read grant degrades gracefully when it is too narrow (you see less); a
 * write applied to the wrong target is the wrong content on somebody's screen.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING THAT TOUCHES BYTES IS HERE. Media files do not fit this transport (the envelope caps a
 * batch at 512 KB against a 500 MB upload limit) and they are not going to arrive by accident
 * through a JSON path. Content distribution is its own channel and its own decision.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING PRIVILEGED IS HERE, and it is an allowlist rather than a blocklist so that a route
 * added to this server later is refused until somebody deliberately adds it. Never reachable, by
 * construction: users, roles, workspace membership, API tokens, SSO, billing, org settings, the
 * node's own mesh state (a hub that could widen its own grant has defeated the entire design), and
 * anything at the server level — restart, update, config, log retention.

 * ⚠️ NORMALISE FIRST, AND SEND WHAT YOU MATCHED. THIS IS THE WHOLE GUARD.
 *
 * The allowlist is the entire security boundary of mesh write, and it was defeated by a backslash.
 * The matcher validated by splitting on '/', so `..\..\..\devices\D1` was ONE segment: it slotted
 * into :itemId and satisfied `DELETE /api/playlists/:id/items/:itemId`. The executor then handed
 * that same raw string to fetch(), which builds its request-target from `new URL().pathname` — and
 * the WHATWG parser turns backslashes into slashes for special schemes and resolves dot segments.
 * Six segments to the guard, three to the server: the request that arrived was
 * `DELETE /api/devices/D1`. `%2e%2e` did the same through decoding, turning "delete one item" into
 * "delete the whole playlist".
 *
 * That reached every PUT and DELETE on every token-mounted router — devices, groups, triggers,
 * folders, and /api/content, which unlinks media from disk. The claim above that nothing here
 * touches bytes was true of the rules and false of what they permitted.
 *
 * The fix is not a longer list of forbidden characters; it is removing the gap between the two
 * parsers. Resolve the path exactly as the executor will, match THAT, and give the caller back the
 * resolved form so the request that goes out is the request that was authorised. Anything a
 * traversal resolves to is then simply a path the allowlist does not contain.
