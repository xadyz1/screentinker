 *
 * A hub knows two independent things: what a node last told it, and whether that node is currently
 * reachable. Collapsing them into online/offline forces a choice between two wrong answers when the
 * LINK fails: report the last known state as current (a green dot from ninety minutes ago), or report
 * everything as offline (a WAN blip on one hub link paints 400 healthy screens red and dispatches an
 * engineer). Both are worse than saying "I do not currently know, and here is when I last did".
 *
 *   live    the origin node is reachable and reported recently — this is current
 *   stale   the origin node is unreachable — this is the LAST KNOWN state, as of a timestamp
 *   down    the origin node IS reachable and says the screen is offline — this is a real fault
 *
 * ⚠️ THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN `stale` AND `down` IS WHO IS BROKEN, and it is the single most useful
 * thing this view communicates. `down` sends someone to a screen. `stale` sends them to a network.
