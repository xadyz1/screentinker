 * Reading a child's own API from the parent, so a remote org can render with the SAME screens the
 * child would draw rather than a reduced summary of it.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS CHANGES THE SHAPE OF I2, AND THE CHANGE IS WORTH STATING PLAINLY.
 *
 * I2 was "there is no downward channel", enforced by the absence of a mechanism: the parent listened
 * and never spoke. That is no longer true — the parent can now ASK. What must remain true is that it
 * cannot TELL, and "we only send reads" is a convention, which is exactly the kind of thing that
 * holds until somebody adds one convenient endpoint.
 *
 * So the enforcement is an ALLOWLIST OF EXACT PATHS, checked on the CHILD, with the method pinned to
 * GET. A parent that asked for anything else gets a refusal from the side that owns the data — not
 * from the side that wants it. A blocklist would have been the natural shape and is the wrong one:
 * it fails open for every route added after it was written.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT RUNS OVER THE EXISTING SOCKET, NOT OVER HTTP. The child dialled out precisely because it may
 * sit behind NAT with no inbound route — the deployment shape this whole feature exists for. A parent
 * making an HTTP request to a child would work on a lab bench and fail at every real site.
