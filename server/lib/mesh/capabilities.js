/*
 * What a node does on a given edge.
 *
 * ⚠️ A SET, NEVER AN ENUM. "Hub", "proxy", "site server", "analytics sink" are not types — they are
 * combinations of the capabilities below. #288 already proved the point by making one box a server
 * and a player at once; an enum would have needed a new member for that, and another for the next
 * combination somebody deploys.
 *
 * The test of this design is that adding a node type requires NO schema change and NO new branch in
 * the pairing logic — only a different set. If a future "regional cache that also consumes
 * proof-of-play but does not relay" needs code changes here, this file failed.
 *
 * ⚠️ CAPABILITY IS NOT PERMISSION. `relays-for-subtree` says a node will carry traffic; it says
 * nothing about what it may read. That is the grant, and it is stored separately on the same edge
 * (see grants.js). A hub edge and a proxy edge can hold identical grants and be entirely different
 * machines. Conflating the two is how "it relays for us" silently becomes "it can read everything
 * it relays" — which invariant I5 exists to forbid.
