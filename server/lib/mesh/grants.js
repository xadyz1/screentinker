/*
 * What one node is allowed to see of another.
 *
 * ⚠️ DATA CATEGORIES, NOT READ/WRITE. This is the distinction a client's security review actually
 * turns on. "Read" as a single permission would mean device names, LAN and public WAN addresses,
 * content metadata and screenshots all travelling together into someone else's database — and a
 * client who wants their MSP to see that screens are alive, but not what is playing on them or where
 * they are, would have no way to say so. Every category below is separately grantable and separately
 * deniable.
 *
 * The vocabulary comes from the Phase −1 inventory (docs/mesh-telemetry-inventory.md), which counted
 * what is actually collected rather than what the schema declares. Two consequences of that audit are
 * baked in here:
 *
 *   - PUBLIC/WAN ADDRESS IS ITS OWN CATEGORY, split from LAN. It is populated for 509 of 509
 *     production devices and it locates a client's premises. A "health only" grant that still shipped
 *     the public IP of every screen would fail the review this exists for.
 *   - THERE IS NO wifi-ssid CATEGORY, because that field is being dropped. 94% of it was not an SSID
 *     and the remainder was geolocatable customer network names.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY CATEGORY DEFAULTS TO DENIED. An empty grant is a valid grant that yields nothing but the
 * fact that the node exists. There is no "all" shorthand and no wildcard — a grant is an explicit
 * list, so adding a category in a later version cannot retroactively widen an existing edge. That is
 * the single most important property in this file.
 *
 * ⚠️ ENFORCED AT THE SOURCE (invariant I10). The node that owns the data decides what leaves it. A
 * denied category is never sent — not sent-and-filtered, not sent-and-hidden. The receiving node is
 * never trusted to police what it was given, because the whole point is that it belongs to someone
 * else.
