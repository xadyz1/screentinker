 * relay host. The guard is right to be blunt — this is prose bending around it, not the reverse.)
 *
 * Everything else about the mesh moved one hop. A node reported its OWN devices, and anything it
 * mirrored from below stopped there — so in a three-tier estate the top hub saw the middle node's
 * workspaces and not a single screen, and the middle node was a wall rather than a relaying tier. Content
 * learned to travel two hops before telemetry did, which is the wrong way round: the whole reason
 * an MSP wants a middle tier is to see everything beneath it.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONLY FOR CHILDREN THAT AGREED, and that agreement is the child's alone. A node two hops up has
 * no relationship with the site at the bottom: "my MSP may see my screens" is not the same
 * agreement as "and so may whoever my MSP reports to". The child sets share_upward on its own
 * uplink, announces it, and this reads what was announced (peer_shares_upward) rather than
 * assuming. Absent means no, so every relationship formed before relaying existed stays one hop.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ORIGIN IS PRESERVED. A relayed screen is reported with the node it actually belongs to,
 * never as this node's own — a hub that could not tell whose screen it was looking at would file a
 * customer's estate under the wrong company, which is the worst available bug here.

 * nowhere upstream until somebody hung a screen on it. That is the wrong dependency: whether a
 * relationship exists and whether it currently has hardware are different questions, and an
 * operator setting up a site wants to see the site appear before the screens do.

   * ⚠️ WHY A SCREEN IS MISBEHAVING — the question support actually needs answered, and the one an
   * MSP could not ask about a customer's site. They could see a screen was unhealthy and had no way
   * to find out why, which is the difference between fixing it from a desk and driving to it.
   *
   * ⚠️ THE ERROR PAYLOAD IS NOT SENT WHOLESALE. `error_data` and `context` are captured by the
   * player and can carry anything the page had — a URL with a token in it, a widget's fetched
   * content, an operator's own text. What travels is the fingerprint (which groups repeats), the
   * message, the URL's ORIGIN AND PATH without its query, and the timestamp. That is enough to say
   * "this screen is failing to load that widget, forty times an hour" and not enough to hand over
   * whatever happened to be in a query string.
