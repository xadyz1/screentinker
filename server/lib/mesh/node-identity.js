 * boot, and that is the whole ceremony: no license check, no activation call, no central registry to
 * be down, nothing to phone home to. An air-gapped install is a first-class install, and it cannot be
 * first-class if identity requires the internet.
 *
 * ⚠️ IDENTITY IS POSITION-INDEPENDENT (invariant I4). The id does not encode a parent, a path, or a
 * role. Re-parenting a node changes the paths displayed to an operator and nothing else — every row
 * that node ever emitted still resolves to it. Encoding position in an id is comfortable right up to
 * the first reorganisation, at which point all history silently belongs to the wrong place.
 *
 * ⚠️ NODE IDENTITY IS NOT DEVICE IDENTITY. #288 made one box a server and a player simultaneously, so
 * a node may also appear in its own `devices` table. The association is recorded explicitly rather
 * than inferred, because a rollup that counts the host as both a node and one of its own screens
 * reports a site as having one more screen than it has — a small, permanent, unexplainable error in
 * exactly the numbers an MSP invoices against.

 * 2.0.0. Not a conservative guess — no earlier build can speak mesh at all, because the protocol does
 * not exist before it. Setting the floor anywhere lower would be pretending to support a conversation
 * that cannot occur.
 *
 * The point of naming it now is that WITHOUT a stated floor the envelope can never change: every
 * future edit has to stay compatible with every node ever shipped, forever, and in practice that
 * means it does not get edited and the design ossifies.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS A DIFFERENT PROMISE FROM PLAYER COMPATIBILITY, which stays maximal and is unchanged. A
 * player is a screen on a wall that someone may not touch for three years. A node is a participant
 * that writes into someone else's database, and standing it up takes five minutes — "reasonably
 * current" is a fair ask of a node and an unfair one of a panel.

 * pre-release node, including one running byte-identical code. `-0` is the canonical idiom for
 * "the lowest possible 2.0.0 prerelease", so it admits the alphas and still refuses 1.9.x.
 *
 * This is the same trap that reverts hand-delivered test builds over OTA. It is worth stating twice
 * because it presents completely differently each time: there it silently downgrades a tester, here
 * it refuses a connection with a message that looks like a genuine version mismatch.
