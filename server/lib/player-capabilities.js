 * What a player can actually do.
 *
 * The dashboard offered every control to every display. A browser tab cannot reboot its host, a
 * Tizen TV has no device-owner concept, a BrightSign has no per-window brightness — so those
 * buttons did nothing, silently, and looked like bugs. "UI that reports success and changes
 * nothing" is a recurring shape in this codebase and this module exists to end it.
 *
 * The player DECLARES its capabilities at registration, because only the player knows at runtime:
 * an Android device gains real screenshots when accessibility is switched on, and loses Tier-2
 * commands when it is not device owner. A static per-platform table could never know that.
 *
 * ⚠️ Legacy displays declare nothing. A fleet of several hundred is not going to update before the
 * next dashboard deploy, so an absent declaration falls back to a per-platform baseline rather
 * than to "supports nothing" — which would strip the UI for every existing display at once. The
 * baseline is deliberately optimistic for things that always worked, and pessimistic for anything
 * that depends on runtime state.

    //      needs only require(), not a host bridge — so it works on the exact units the note feared.
    //   2. The canvas fallback is no longer silent: renderCaptureCanvas() paints "Video is playing
    //      on the hardware plane and cannot be captured" rather than a black rectangle.
    //
    // They stay out for a DIFFERENT and narrower reason: captureScreen() needs a node-enabled
    // widget. A widget built by the BSN Supervisor has no require(), so there the path really does
    // end at a canvas that cannot see the video. This baseline cannot tell the two apart.
