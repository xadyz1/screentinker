// #144 — OTA update-check circuit-breaker + phantom-version guard.
//
// The /api/update/check handler offered the update whenever client !== latest (raw
// string inequality, not semver). A device that can't APPLY the update (old/broken
// OTA client like 1.7.12, signing mismatch, Fire OS) keeps reporting the same old
// version and is told update_available=true on every poll. A fast poll loop (10-30s)
// then saturates the event loop (prod loop-lag 49s).
//
// Two independent axes (kept separate on purpose):
//
//  1. RATE breaker (primary, immediate). Healthy devices poll ~every 12 min, so a key
//     checking MORE than THRESHOLD times within WINDOW (default >3 / 60s) is by
//     definition looping -> throttle update_available for that key with exponential
//     backoff. Catches the fast flood within seconds. A normally-polling device never
//     approaches this rate, so rollout/straggler updates are inherently safe — there
//     is deliberately NO "tolerate the flood for N minutes" grace; slow == safe.
//
//  2. PHANTOM guard (immediate). An unrecognized version, or a prerelease of an OLDER
//     core (a superseded old-minor beta — e.g. 1.9.1-beta4 when latest is 1.9.2-beta3),
//     gets "no offer" on the first check. A RECENT real older version (e.g. beta3 when
//     latest is beta4, or stable 1.7.12) is legitimately offerable and is NOT phantom.
//
// KEYING: keyed on device_id when the client sends one (beta4+ clients -> precise
// per-device throttling), falling back to the reported VERSION when absent (legacy
// clients send only ?version=, and the site is behind NAT so IP is useless). So every
// device is covered: new clients per-device, stuck legacy clients per-version.
//
// Constants are env-tunable for ops + tests.
