/*
 * The playlist-inheritance resolver, as SQL, in ONE place.
 *
 * Both the boot migration (db/database.js) and any test fixture that hand-builds a schema apply it
 * from here. The alternative — pasting CREATE VIEW into a fixture — is how a fixture drifts from
 * the real schema and starts proving things about a database that does not exist.
 *
 * ⚠️ Apply this AFTER every table-rebuilding migration. SQLite refuses to drop a table a view still
 * references, so defining these early broke the tenant delete-cascade migration on every install
 * ("no such table: main.devices"). A view is a dependency on every table it names.
 *
 * DROP-then-CREATE rather than IF NOT EXISTS, so the definition can never drift from the code that
 * ships with it: a view pinned at first-create is a migration you cannot amend.
