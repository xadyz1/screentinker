/*
 * Decks: authored as one document, published as things the rest of the product already understands.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE DECISION THIS FILE ENCODES. Every survey of how signage vendors handle multi-page content
 * came back the same way — one template is ONE slide, and a sequence of slides is a playlist. So the
 * temptation is to say "decks are playlists, don't build a deck editor" and stop. That is right
 * about the DATA and wrong about the AUTHORING: building six slides that share a look, one widget at
 * a time, and then assembling a playlist by hand, is a worse job than it needs to be.
 *
 * Both halves are available. A deck is an editable SOURCE document; publishing it emits one slide
 * widget per page plus a playlist that orders them. Nothing downstream learns a new content type —
 * scheduling, groups, inheritance, the resolver and every player keep working because what reaches
 * them is a playlist of widgets, which is a thing that already existed. The deck row is the only
 * new object, and nothing but the editor reads it.
 *
 * ⚠️ LEAST-DESTRUCTIVE ON REPUBLISH. Publishing touches only the items whose widget this deck owns.
 * If an operator has added other content to the deck's playlist by hand, it is left exactly where it
 * is rather than being swept away by the next publish — a rebuild-from-scratch would be simpler to
 * write and would silently delete somebody's work.
