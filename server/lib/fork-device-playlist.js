/*
 * "Add content to THIS screen" on a device that inherits its playlist.
 *
 * Before inheritance existed, every device held a COPY of its group's playlist id, so editing "this
 * screen" silently edited the group's playlist — and therefore every other screen using it. The
 * resolver did not change that; it only made it visible, because the device page now says
 * "Inherited from Lobby" directly beside the Add Content button. A label that says inherited next to
 * a control that edits the shared thing is worse than either behaviour on its own.
 *
 * So a per-device edit FORKS: the inherited playlist is copied into one owned by this screen, and
 * the row is stamped playlist_source = 'device' so the resolver stops looking at the group.
 *
 * ⚠️ The fork carries the source's PUBLISHED SNAPSHOT, not just its draft items. Devices play
 * published_snapshot, so handing a screen a brand-new playlist with no snapshot would blank it the
 * instant someone added an image — the screen would go dark as a side effect of an addition. With
 * the snapshot copied, the screen keeps playing exactly what it was playing until the operator
 * publishes their change, which is what the draft/publish flow means everywhere else.
 *
 * ⚠️ Forking breaks the live link on purpose. Later edits to the group's playlist no longer reach
 * this screen — that is what "override" means, and the badge now says so.

 * belonging to the shared playlist — an edit, a delete, a reorder list — need it to point at the
 * equivalent row in the fork instead; without it they would go on mutating the shared playlist,
 * which is the whole thing being fixed.
