/*
 * Slide widgets: a template joined to a record, at render time.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ONE THING THIS FILE EXISTS TO DO: keep the changeable text OUT of the layout.
 *
 * Every other widget in this codebase bakes its content into `config.html` and re-emits the whole
 * document on every edit. That is fine for a clock. It is fatal for a slide somebody comes back to
 * three months later to change a number, because there is no route back to the form — the HTML IS
 * the record, and it has already lost which parts were fields.
 *
 * Fifteen signage products were surveyed before this was written and not one of them makes the
 * changeable text part of the template. Scala has template variables bound to a CMS record;
 * Appspace pairs `schema.json` with `model.json`; Xibo deliberately keeps widget HTML and widget
 * data in SEPARATE files so a data change never rebuilds the layout. The single vendor that does
 * what ScreenTinker does today is the one where editing later genuinely breaks.
 *
 * So: `config.template` is a VIEW — geometry, style, motion, and a `slot` name per element.
 * `config.fields` is a RECORD — `{ slot: value }`. They meet here and nowhere else. Editing a
 * headline writes one string into `fields` and bumps the widget's rev; the template is untouched,
 * which is what makes the round trip possible at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERYTHING IS BOUNDED, because all of it lands in an HTML document. Values are clamped to
 * ranges and allowlists rather than sanitised in place: an out-of-range number becomes the nearest
 * legal one, an unknown enum becomes the default, and unknown keys are dropped entirely. A slide is
 * authored by a workspace editor and rendered into a sandboxed iframe, but "it is only staff" is
 * not a security model, and a 40,000-character headline is a layout attack whoever typed it.

 * words also got them from a field. A clock shows words and reads no field; a QR reads a field and
 * shows no words. Collapsing them again drops the font for a clock — which renders it in whatever
 * face the panel happens to have, the exact "different on every screen" failure the bundled font
 * set exists to end — or emits a face for a QR that has nothing to set in it.
 *
 * `config` is what keeps these kinds out of the vocabulary offered to the AI slide generator

/*
 * ⚠️ ONE CONSTANT SCRIPT, AND EVERY PARAMETER ARRIVES THROUGH THE DOM.
 *
 * This is the whole security design of the feature, and it is worth stating plainly because the
 * obvious implementation is the dangerous one. `frontend/js/views/designer.js` builds a script per
 * element by interpolating the element's configuration into JavaScript source — `setInterval` with
 * a date pasted in, `fetch` with a URL pasted in. That makes operator input part of a program, and
 * the only thing standing between a slide and arbitrary script in the frame is whether every one of
 * those interpolations was escaped for a JS string context. Some of them are not.
 *
 * Here the script below is a CONSTANT: byte-for-byte identical in every document this module emits,
 * containing no interpolation of any kind. Configuration reaches it as `data-` attributes, which
 * pass through escapeHtml on the way in, and it reads them with getAttribute — a string API that
 * cannot execute anything. It writes with `textContent` and never `innerHTML`, so even a value that
 * somehow arrived carrying markup lands on the screen as the characters the operator typed rather
 * than as elements. There is no path from a slide's configuration to executed code.
 *
 * ⚠️ A LIVE ELEMENT WITH NO WORKING SCRIPT RENDERS EMPTY, DELIBERATELY. The tempting fallback is to
 * bake the time at render into the element so something shows if the script never runs. But a slide
 * document is fetched once and can sit on a panel for the length of a playlist loop, so that
 * fallback is a clock displaying a time that is quietly, plausibly wrong — which on a wall is worse
 * than an empty box, because nobody can tell by looking.
 */
/*
 * ⚠️ THE SLIDE IS SIZED BY SCRIPT, AND EVERY WORD OF THAT IS DELIBERATE.
 *
 * A slide is laid out in % (positions) and cqw (type) against the stage, so THE STAGE'S ASPECT IS
 * THE COMPOSITION. Given the panel's whole box it takes the panel's aspect, and a 16:9 deck on a
 * 2560x1800 screen becomes a different slide: `cover` backgrounds cropped a fifth off each side,
 * headlines past the edges, the eyebrow off-screen entirely. This fits the stage to the shape the
 * deck was authored in and centres it, so the slide is the same composition on every panel.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT CONVERTS cqw TO px, which is the half that cannot be done in CSS.
 *
 * Container queries shipped in Chrome 105. Android WebView 91 is still what a lot of signage
 * hardware runs — every `font-size:6.2cqw` on it is an INVALID declaration that the engine drops,
 * so those panels have never rendered a slide at the authored size; the oversized, clipped text
 * that started this was the browser's default size being font-boosted, not a layout bug.
 *
 * The conversion reads the cqw number out of the element's own style ATTRIBUTE rather than the
 * CSSOM, for exactly that reason: on an engine that rejected the declaration the CSSOM has nothing
 * to read, while the attribute is still the literal text the server wrote. 1cqw is 1% of the
 * stage's width by definition, so the arithmetic is the whole conversion.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING HERE CHANGES THE DOM. Three CSS-only attempts at this letterbox — a flex wrapper, an
 * absolutely-positioned wrapper, and containment moved onto the body — each made WebView 91 paint
 * the FIRST slide of a deck and then go black for every one after it. The stage stays body's only
 * child, keeps `position:relative`, and only its box metrics and font sizes are written. If this
 * script never runs, the CSS below is the old full-box stage and the slide renders as it did
 * before — degraded, never blank.

  /*
   * ⚠️ ALWAYS MUTED, AND THAT IS NOT A DEFAULT — IT IS THE ONLY OPTION.
   *
   * Three separate reasons, any one of which is sufficient. Autoplay without a gesture is only
   * permitted for muted media, so an unmuted background would simply never start. A slide is one
   * item among many on a wall, and the player already decides which ZONE owns the audio
   * (showZoneItem mutes every zone but the first) — a widget that made its own noise would fight
   * that decision from inside an iframe it cannot see out of. And a background is scenery; scenery
   * that talks over the video in the next zone is a support call.
   *
   * ⚠️ hwz="off" IS FOR BRIGHTSIGN AND IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS RENDERS AT ALL THERE.
   *
   * With hardware z-order the video decodes onto a plane the DOM sits BEHIND, so a background
   * video would play OVER the headline and the cut-outs — the exact inverse of a background. The
   * codebase already documents this for transitions and PiP (brightsign/st-bridge.js, and
   * suppressMedia in the player, which pauses video rather than covering it because covering it
   * does not work). `hwz="off"` asks that element to decode into the graphics plane instead, where
   * it composites normally.
   *
   * It is per-element and reversible, deliberately unlike roVideoMode.SetGraphicsZOrder("front") —
   * which st-bridge.js:482 says was left alone because changing z-order globally risks hiding video
   * entirely on players that currently work. Every other platform ignores an unknown attribute.
