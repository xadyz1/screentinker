/*
 * Make sure the dependencies this build needs are actually installed and loadable — BEFORE anything
 * requires them.
 *
 * The normal upgrade path (scripts/upgrade.sh) runs `npm ci --omit=dev`, so this is not for the
 * happy case. It is for the three ways a running box ends up with the wrong node_modules:
 *
 *   ROLLBACK      checking out an older tag to back out a bad release restores that tag's
 *                 package.json but not its packages, so the server dies on a MODULE_NOT_FOUND for
 *                 something the newer build had removed. That is a bad moment to be reading a
 *                 stack trace: you are already rolling back because something else broke.
 *   NODE UPGRADE  better-sqlite3 is a native module compiled against one ABI. Upgrading Node makes
 *                 every boot fail with NODE_MODULE_VERSION mismatch, which reads like database
 *                 corruption and is not.
 *
 *                 ⚠️ better-sqlite3 is pinned to EXACTLY 12.9.0, not a caret range, and the reason
 *                 is invisible from package.json: 12.10.0 DROPPED the prebuilt binary for Node 20
 *                 (ABI 115) while still advertising `"node": "20.x || ..."` in engines. So a caret
 *                 resolves to 12.11.x, finds no prebuild on Node 20, and silently falls through to
 *                 `node-gyp rebuild` — a from-source compile during install, and during the repair
 *                 below. That matters here: this file rebuilds synchronously BEFORE the server
 *                 listens, and prod's systemd unit has TimeoutStartSec=90 with Restart=always, so a
 *                 slow or failing compile is a boot loop rather than a self-heal. 12.9.0 is the last
 *                 version shipping prebuilds for BOTH Node 20 (115) and Node 22 (127), which is what
 *                 lets the runtime move without the module having to compile at all.
 *                 Re-check the release assets before widening the pin.
 *   HAND EDITS    a `git checkout`, a partly-copied tree, an interrupted install.
 *
 * All three present as a server that will not start, with an error that names a file rather than
 * the action needed. Detecting and repairing is a few seconds; diagnosing is an outage.
 *
 * ⚠️ Deliberately dependency-free — only Node builtins. Anything it required could be the very
 * thing that is missing.
 *
 * Set ST_SKIP_DEP_PREFLIGHT=1 to turn it off (air-gapped hosts, or an operator who manages
 * node_modules themselves and does not want a boot reaching for the network).
