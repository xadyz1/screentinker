 * Everything we can learn from the BYTES: thumbnail, display dimensions, duration.

 * Extracted so PUT /api/content/:id/replace derives them the same way an upload does. It used
 * to carry its own shorter copy that handled images only — so replacing a video wiped the row's
 * duration, dimensions and thumbnail, and replacing a portrait photo re-introduced the EXIF
 * orientation bug (#170) that the ingest path fixes with imageDisplayDims + .rotate(). A second
 * copy of this logic is a second place for it to rot; there is now one.
 *
 * Best-effort by contract: a missing ffprobe or a decode failure yields nulls and a warning, never
 * a throw — the file itself is already stored and is worth more than its metadata.
 *
 * @returns {{width:number|null, height:number|null, durationSec:number|null, thumbnailPath:string|null}}
