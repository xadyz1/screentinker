 * #299 — the rules for accepting a play a PLAYER recorded while it was offline.
 *
 * ⚠️ THESE TIMESTAMPS COME FROM THE PANEL, AND THE PANEL'S CLOCK IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY. A live play
 * is stamped by the server (`strftime('%s','now')`), which is why nothing here was needed before.
 * A backfilled play cannot be: the whole point is that it happened hours ago, so the player has to
 * say when — and a signage panel with a dead RTC or no NTP will cheerfully report 1970, or next
 * year, or a duration of eleven days.
 *
 * A wrong timestamp is worse than a missing row. A gap is visibly a gap; a play stamped 1970 is
 * indistinguishable from real data in a report an advertiser is billed from. So anything outside a
 * defensible window is DROPPED rather than clamped into looking plausible.
 *
 * Pure and clock-injected, so the rules can be tested without a socket, a database or a real clock
 * — the same shape as lib/incident-classify next door, and for the same reason: the handler calls
 * exactly this, so the tests and the live path cannot disagree.

 * Close plays that were left open, using the start of the play that followed.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS IS SOUND, NOT A GUESS. A play row is opened by play_start and closed by play_end. If
 * the link drops between them the close is lost and the row stays open forever with no duration —
 * one per outage, plus every reboot mid-item. But the device advancing to another item is itself
 * proof the previous one ran until that moment: the successor's started_at IS the predecessor's
 * end. Nothing is invented; the evidence was already in the table.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONLY WHERE A SUCCESSOR EXISTS. The item genuinely playing right now is the newest row and has
 * none, so it is left open — which is correct, it has not ended.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND ONLY FOR AS LONG AS THE ITEM COULD PLAUSIBLY HAVE PLAYED. This is the guard that matters
 * most, and a blanket 24h cap was NOT enough: on alpha it closed a 20-second clip with 31,368
 * seconds — 8.7 hours of "runtime" for one clip — because the device had been offline in between
 * with no backfill available, so the next play was the following morning. That is precisely the
 * fabricated-data failure this module refuses elsewhere.
 *
 * So the cap is taken from the CONTENT'S OWN LENGTH where we know it: a 20-second clip cannot have
 * played for eight hours, whatever the gap says. Where the length is unknown (widgets, images with
 * an operator-set dwell) a modest absolute cap applies instead. Beyond it the row stays open, which
 * is honest — a missing duration reads as missing; an invented one reads as fact.
 *
 * `completed` is deliberately NOT set. We have evidence it played for that long, not evidence it
 * ran to its end — an error-advance looks identical from here. Duration is the number reports are
 * built on; claiming completion would be asserting more than the data supports.
 *

/**
 * Close plays that have been open longer than they could possibly have played.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE LEAK closeStrandedPlays CANNOT REACH, and it is not small: the database this was written
 * against carried 36,096 open rows, 35,982 of them more than a day old, the oldest from June. Read
 * that as one instance, NOT as the size of the problem — a 73-device field install upgrading to
 * 2.0.0 came up with **494,000**, which is why the drain now has a boot mode (lib/boot-defer.js).
 *
 * closeStrandedPlays infers an end from THE NEXT PLAY on the same device and zone. That is the
 * better answer when it exists — it is a measurement rather than an assumption — but it needs a
 * next row, and it deliberately leaves the row open when the gap exceeds the item's own length,
 * rather than crediting a screen with hours it spent switched off. Both are right. The consequence
 * is that the last play before a device goes quiet, and every play interrupted by a power cut, is
 * left open with nothing that will ever revisit it.
 *
 * So this is the other half: once a play has been open longer than its own content could have run,
 * the end event is never arriving. It is closed AT ITS CEILING — started_at + its own length —
 * which keeps the original promise that downtime is never credited as playback, while ending the
 * row. `completed` is set to 0 because we do not know that it finished; only that it stopped.
 *
 * ⚠️ CHUNKED, and that is the lesson of this very issue. This runs against a table with 1.44M rows
 * on a synchronous driver; an unbounded UPDATE here would be the thing it was written to prevent.
