/*
 * ⚠️ NEITHER THE TRIGGER SECRET NOR THE ENROLMENT KEY IS EVER GIVEN TO AN API TOKEN, even a
 * full-scope one, and this is a stronger rule than the one applied to settings_pin.
 *
 * The PIN unlocks a menu for someone already standing at the panel. These two are remote
 * credentials, and each converts a read into a write that no scope on that token ever granted:
 *
 *   trigger_secret — makes an unauthenticated LAN datagram change what a screen displays, so a
 *     READ-scoped integration token would become "may put content on any of them".
 *   enrol_key      — is strictly MORE than that. It does not push content to a screen; it lets the
 *     holder BE the screen: register as that display, receive its playlist and its commands, and
 *     report as it. It was withheld from the device LIST for blast radius (the reasoning that
 *     governs settings_pin) and that is where the first version stopped — the detail endpoint has
 *     no scope gate, so a read-scoped token could read it. Same class of escalation as the trigger
 *     secret, on a credential that outranks it.
 *
 * A dashboard session keeps both, because a human configuring a Crestron panel has to type the
 * secret somewhere, and the operator pasting a player URL into vMix has to be able to read it —
 * those screens are the only place either exists. The key is opt-in and only ever set on a display
 * somebody asked to make a web player, so this narrows an exposure rather than removing a feature.
