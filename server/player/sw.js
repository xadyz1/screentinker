// v25: the rev-pinned cache-first branch now also covers /api/content/:id/bundle, and the player
// fetches that URL SAME-ORIGIN and mounts it as srcdoc — so unlike widgets, this branch is actually
// reachable for bundles and their offline story is the Cache API rather than the HTTP cache.
// v24: an empty playlist payload no longer prunes. `assignments: []` is what the server sends for a
// device between playlists AND for a snapshot that failed to parse, and treating it as "keep
// nothing" wiped the panel's entire offline library on a message that means nothing of the sort.
// v23: offline.cache is claimed only when a worker is actually IN CONTROL — a real BrightSign
// widget exposes navigator.serviceWorker, refuses to register one, and was advertising the
// capability to the fleet regardless.
// v22: worker scope widened to '/' (it never controlled /player before) + prune-to-playlist, so a
// replaced asset's superseded copy is reclaimed rather than waiting on the quota.
// v21: chunked resumable content prefetch + revision-keyed media URLs — index.html gained
// mediaUrl()/requestOfflineCache() and this worker gained the message handler, so an old shell
// cache would pair a new worker with a player that never posts it a playlist.
// v20: rc3 changed the fetch strategy AND the shipped player assets. The activate handler deletes
// every cache whose name does not match, so leaving this at v19 kept the previous shell cache alive
// — a player then ran a new index.html against a stale st-bridge.js and threw on every heartbeat.
// Bump whenever a shipped /player asset changes shape; content lives in its own cache, so this
// costs a small re-download and never re-fetches the playlist.

  //
  // MEASURED LIMIT, do not read more into this branch than it delivers. The player mounts widgets in
  // an iframe sandboxed to `allow-scripts` with NO allow-same-origin (index.html,
  // renderWidgetBuffered), so that frame is an OPAQUE-origin client — and a service worker does not
  // control opaque-origin clients. Its navigation request never reaches this handler. Driven in
  // Chrome against a live server: a clock widget mounted five times over 25s and the shell cache
  // held zero widget entries, while a plain fetch() of the identical URL from the controlled page
  // was intercepted and stored. So this branch serves anything that reaches it — a same-origin
  // fetch, a future non-sandboxed mount — and today the player's own widgets are not that.
  //
  // What actually keeps widgets rendering offline right now is the HTTP cache plus the server's
  // `max-age=31536000, immutable` on a rev-pinned render (routes/widgets.js). That is sound in a
  // desktop browser and is NOT a documented-persistent store on BrightSign, which guarantees
  // survival across reboots for IndexedDB, localStorage and SQLite only — the same gap that made
  // content caching necessary. Closing it properly means routing the render through a same-origin
  // fetch and mounting it as srcdoc; granting the frame allow-same-origin instead would hand widget
  // scripts the player's origin, which is not a trade worth making for an offline nicety.
  //
  // ⚠️ AND THIS IS WHY BUNDLES TAKE THE PRESCRIPTION ABOVE. A widget is mounted by URL into a
  // sandboxed frame, so the branch below cannot see it. An HTML bundle is fetched by the PLAYER
  // PAGE — a controlled, same-origin client — and mounted as srcdoc, so its render request DOES
  // reach this handler and DOES land in the Cache API. Bundles therefore get the persistent store
  // widgets still cannot, on the platform (BrightSign) where the HTTP cache guarantees nothing.
