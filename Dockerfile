# ScreenTinker server image: serves the dashboard, the web player, and the
# device API. All mutable state (db, uploads, jwt secret) lives under /data so it
# survives container restarts - mount a volume there. A built ScreenTinker.apk
# can be mounted at /data/ScreenTinker.apk to enable OTA APK downloads.
#
# No TLS in the image: it listens on plain HTTP :3001. Front it with a
# TLS-terminating reverse proxy / Cloudflare in production.

# --- builder: install production deps (better-sqlite3 is the only native one left; image
# decoding is pure JS + WASM since sharp was dropped, and sharp is now a devDependency that
# --omit=dev leaves out entirely) ---
