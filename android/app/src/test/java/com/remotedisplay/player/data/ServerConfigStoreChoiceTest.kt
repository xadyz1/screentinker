/**
 * #312 — which preference store a paired display reads its identity from.
 *
 * The old code picked whichever store OPENED. On RK3566 / OP-TEE the Keystore is unreliable right
 * after a cold boot, so a display whose data had gone to the plain store at install time would, on
 * any later boot where the Keystore happened to work, open the EMPTY encrypted store instead:
 * server_url came back blank, the service logged "No server URL configured", and the reconnect
 * backstop had nothing to dial. Silent, and it looked exactly like a networking fault.
 *
 * The rule is now "use the store that actually holds the identity", and this is that rule.
