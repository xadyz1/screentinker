/**
 * Trigger wire parsing and token resolution — the decision half of the fire path.
 * See docs/triggers-design.md and shared/trigger-vectors.json.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION OF A SECURITY DECISION. The JS player has the other one
 * (server/lib/trigger-resolve.js), and two of these in two languages WILL drift — silently, and in
 * a direction that matters: one player accepting a payload the other refuses is a hole nobody sees
 * until it is used. The shared vector file is the contract and TriggerResolveTest holds this file
 * to it, exactly as ScheduleEval is held to shared/schedule-vectors.json. If this disagrees with a
 * vector, this is wrong.
 *
 * ⚠️ Nothing here touches the network or a View. Both transports parse with parseWire(), decide with
 * evaluate(), and only then render. One decision, two doors.
