/**

 *
 * ⚠️ BOTH CONVERGE ON ONE HANDLER. Neither transport parses, resolves, or decides — they read bytes
 * and hand them to [onPayload], which calls [TriggerResolve]. If a transport ever grows its own
 * resolution the two doors drift and only one of them gets the next security fix.
 *
 * ⚠️ OFF BY DEFAULT, AND SEPARATELY. This opens listening ports on a LAN that change what appears on
 * a screen. UDP is the larger risk of the two and has its own flag: one datagram to a multicast
 * group or a broadcast address reaches EVERY player on the segment at once, which is categorically
 * more than a unicast POST at one host.
