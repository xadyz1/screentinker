/**
 * Collisions, the held set and the lease — the Android half of docs/triggers-design.md §6/§7/§8.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS MIRRORS THE JS STATE MACHINE IN server/player/index.html AND IS NOT YET HELD TO SHARED
 * VECTORS. The resolver is (shared/trigger-vectors.json); this is not, because the vector format
 * covers a single decision and this is a sequence of them. That is a real drift risk and it is
 * named here rather than left to be discovered: if these two disagree, an alarm behaves differently
 * on an Android panel than on the screen beside it. Extending the vectors to sequences is the right
 * next move.
 *
 * The rules, in one place so they can be compared to the JS by reading:
 *  - highest priority wins; ties go to the last arrival
 *  - only `until_cleared` is HELD when preempted — a spent `once` must not return later
 *  - a restored trigger restarts at item 1; being covered is not a renewal of its lease
 *  - a re-fire of the active trigger is a no-op that RENEWS the lease
 *  - a re-assert of a HELD trigger renews it without disturbing the screen
 *  - the lease ticks while held, and a lapsed hold is dropped rather than restored
