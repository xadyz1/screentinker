/**
 * Renders a TRIGGER's playlist as a fullscreen opaque overlay.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS IS NOT PipOverlay. A PiP shows ONE item from a `uri`; a trigger targets a PLAYLIST,
 * and that difference is the whole point of the feature — the target is a playlist precisely so
 * every item is library content that can be held on disk, which an arbitrary URL cannot be. So this
 * rotates a list, resolves each item from the OFFLINE CACHE, and never fetches from the network on
 * the fire path. If it cannot resolve an item locally it says so loudly rather than reaching out:
 * the one moment a trigger matters is the moment the WAN is down.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY IT OWNS ITS OWN ExoPlayer. The base playlist's MediaPlayerManager holds the content
 * surface. Reusing it would tear down what the trigger is supposed to be covering, and a clear
 * would have nothing to return to. The mirrored lesson from the web player is sharper still: there,
 * a YouTube item inside a trigger destroyed the BASE playlist's singleton player with no rebuild
 * path, and its error branch advanced the base playlist underneath the alarm.
 *
 * Behaviour is held to the web player (server/player/index.html triggerFire/showZoneItem):
 *  - the overlay is fullscreen and opaque; geometry is reserved and the API refuses it
 *  - the overlay has audio, and the base is silenced while it covers the screen
 *  - a restored trigger restarts at item 1
 *  - a video advances on `ended`, WITH an error handler and a slack timer — a zone video that
 *    advanced only on `ended` left a region black for days when a clip was undecodable
 *  - YouTube items are dropped: unpinnable, so they break the offline guarantee
